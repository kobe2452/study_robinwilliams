\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Washington, May 2 -- The sensationalisation of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  coverage in media may trigger vulnerable readers, especially teenagers, to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  themselves, a study has indicated 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The link between news and future \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was strongest when the media reported on the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of a famous person, or when news reports included details such as the time, place and method of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the researchers noted.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The more sensational the coverage of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and the more details the story provides, then the more likely there are to be more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," Madelyn Gould of the New York State Psychiatric Institute was quoted as saying in a statement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After analysing 48 cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  clusters, researchers found that groups of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are more likely to be preceded by news reports on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than individual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "After a prominent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the community, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in that area might temporarily increase," researchers said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the case of a celebrity \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate could go up nationwide.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To understand this phenomenon, the team focused on teenage \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  clusters in the US.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They examined newspaper archives from the period between the first \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in each cluster and the second.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The results showed that clustered \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were preceded, on average, by more news stories than noncluster \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The likelihood of a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cluster also increased if newspapers reported on a celebrity \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in great detail.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Our findings support the interpretation that media portrayals of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  might have a role in the emergence of some teenage \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  clusters," the researcher said in the study published in the journal The Lancet Psychiatry.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 A PANEL of experts released a groundbreaking study recently with convincing arguments showing news coverage of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can increase the number of these tragic deaths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report, released through the Annenberg Public Policy Centre, explored the troubling issue of "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  contagion" or copycat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  linked to news coverage. It points out that research finds an increase in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by readers or viewers when:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 <li/> The number of stories about individual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  increases. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 <li/> A particular death is reported at length or in many stories.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 <li/> The story of an individual death by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is placed on the front page or at the beginning of a broadcast.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 <li/> The headlines about specific \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths are dramatic.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Through its policy on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  coverage, The Star tries to be responsible, yet still inform the public about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  when it is newsworthy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Our policy on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is not to indicate that a death was a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unless there is some overriding public interest in doing so. All stories mentioning \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  must be cleared by the city editor and the senior editor on the news desk before they are published" the policy reads.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Annenberg \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  recommendations for the media support this thrust. They ask all news organizations to think carefully about portrayal of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Media stories about individual deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  may be newsworthy and need to be covered, but they also have the potential to do harm," the report states.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 So what are the major considerations when covering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 News organizations should avoid any portrayal of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that may be viewed as heroic or romantic. They should not give detailed descriptions of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  methods or detailed descriptions or pictures of the location of a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . They should not present \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as an "inexplicable act" of an otherwise healthy or high-achieving person. The report also says, whenever possible, to avoid referring to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in a headline.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When covering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , reporters should ask if the victim had received treatment for depression or any other mental health disorder and if he or she had a problem with substance abuse. This helps shed light on the varied and complex issues and events that may cause \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report does not suggest eliminating \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  coverage. It urges news organizations to provide stories that inform readers and viewers about the causes of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , its warning signs, trends in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates and recent treatment advances.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The research behind the study is compelling.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It found that after an education campaign on the coverage of subway \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  aimed at journalists in Vienna in 1987, subway \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and non-fatal subway \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts dropped by more than 80 per cent after six months. All journalists would be wise to take the recommendations seriously.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Saturday Star puzzle page has had some embarrassing mix-ups lately. The Prize crossword for Saturday, Aug. 11, 2001 was incorrect. The clues were correct, but the grid did not match them.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Editors tried to solve the problem by printing what they thought was the correct puzzle on A2 last Saturday. However it was a puzzle that had already run a few weeks back.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Many readers were understandably riled. This week's crossword has been proofread and vetted by many sets of eyes and should be fine. The Star apologizes to all the puzzle enthusiasts who called to complain.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The rate of female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  across the state is the highest it has ever been, with 6.6 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 people between 1990 and 2010.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Some factors contributing to this could be the long hours working away from home that could lead to a sense of isolation, family breakdown, increase in alcohol use and increased stress."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 People searching the Internet for information on ways to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are more likely to come across sites encouraging it than sites offering help, research showed yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Almost half of sites contain details on how to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  while one in five hits are for "dedicated \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites", a study found. Half of these were found to be "encouraging, promoting or facilitating \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ". 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Researchers led by Lucy Biddle, professor of epidemiology at the University of Bristol, said media reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and its portrayal on TV were known to influence suicidal behaviour, "particularly the choice of method used".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, little was known about the influence of the Internet, they said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The team searched the Internet in May 2007 for sites providing instructions and information on methods of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They used four popular search engines - Google, Yahoo, MSN and Ask15 - to search the entire web, not just British sites.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The researchers selected 12 terms that were entered into each search engine in turn. The first 10 hits retrieved by each search were then analysed, with a total of 240 sites identified and 480 hits reviewed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The terms used were: \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  methods; \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sure methods; most effective methods of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; methods of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; ways to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; how to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; how to kill yourself; easy \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  methods; best \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  methods; pain-free \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and quick \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The authors said: "Just under a fifth of hits (90) were for dedicated \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites. Half of these were judged to be encouraging, promoting, or facilitating \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; 43 contained personal or other accounts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  methods, providing information and discussing pros and cons but without direct encouragement; and two sites portrayed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or self harm in fashionable terms."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The chief executive of the mental health charity Sane, Marjorie Wallace, said: "Sane remains deeply concerned about the possible influence of the Internet on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates, not least the ease with which information about particular methods can be found."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sir, - In a recent article on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ("Number of deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fell overall last year", Home News, May 31st), it was concluded that deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had fallen by more than 6 per cent when comparing the CSO \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  mortality figures for 2013 to the figures published in 2012. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The article did not clarify that this conclusion was based on comparing the preliminary \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  figures for 2013 to the preliminary figures for 2012. Research conducted by the National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Research Foundation has shown that the preliminary \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  figures published by the CSO are consistently lower than the final \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  figures. The discrepancy between the preliminary and final \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  figures varies from +6 per cent to +20 per cent. This means that, in principle, the final 2013 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  figures may turn out to be even higher than the final \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  figures for 2012.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For example, in 2008, the preliminary \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  figures were 424 and indicated a significant reduction, whereas the final \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  mortality figures included 82 additional \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases (final number, 506), thus turning 2008 into a year with one of the most significant increases. We would recommend caution in interpreting the preliminary \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  figures, and suggest reviewing whether there are any benefits in publishing preliminary \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  mortality figures. It was for this reason that several years ago, the National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Research Foundation developed the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Support and Information System (SSIS), representing a real-time database or register of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 With funding from the National Office for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention, the SSIS was implemented in close collaboration with coroners in Cork city and county between September 2008 and March 2011, covering all consecutive deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Information on factors associated with the death and the deceased were obtained in an appropriately sensitive and confidential manner from sources including coroners, the family, and healthcare professionals who had been in contact with the deceased.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In this regard, the SSIS obtains information on cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at least two years earlier than the CSO and provides in-depth information on patterns and risk factors of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that is vital and more timely information for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention initiatives. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Further steps are being undertaken to implement this system in other regions in the country. - Yours, etc,

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Divorced men are at least three times as likely to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as any other group, according to a review of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  patterns in Australia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Institute of Health and Welfare found that more than 41,000 Australians committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  over the past 20 years, more than seven people every day. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report found \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates were highest among men over 80 and those aged 20 to 39.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Men aged 20 to 24 had the highest individual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in 1998, at 42.3 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 people, compared to 18.4 for those aged 15 to 19.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report showed that overall \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates jumped by about 9 per cent between 1996 and 1997.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Victoria has the lowest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate of the six states, with 12.4 per 100,000 people, noticeably lower than Queensland's 16.6 per 100,000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The study also found:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Hanging is the most common method of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for men and women.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * For every female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  there are four male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * In 1998, 2683 Australians committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  accounted for 33.8 per cent of injury deaths in 1998 and 2percent of all deaths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Married women have the lowest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in the community.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report's co-author, James Harrison, said divorced and never-married men had been found to have "higher \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates than married men".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in 1998 for divorced men was 134.1 per 100,000 people, compared to 39.3 for never-married men and 13 for widowed men. Among women, divorcees also had the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate, at 11.1 per 100,000 people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Professor Harrison said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  killed more people than road accidents. The reduction in the road toll could be copied by a strong public health effort to curb \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . "It (the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate) has been lower in the past; why shouldn't it get lower in the future?" he said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the third-leading cause of death for 15- to 24-year-olds. First of all, I would like to discuss that why \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts are becoming more and more common among youth. The reasons behind a teen's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be complex. Although \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is relatively rare among children, the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts increases tremendously during adolescence. The risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  increases dramatically when kids and teens have access to firearms at home. That's why any gun in your home should be unloaded, locked, and kept out of the reach of children and teens. While any child or adolescent can develop suicidal thoughts or behavior, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is an especially significant risk for young people who are facing: depression, substance abuse, problems with disruptive or aggressive behaviors. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates differ between boys and girls. Girls think about and attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  about twice as often as boys, and tend to attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by overdosing on drugs or cutting themselves. Yet boys die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  about four times as often as girls, perhaps because they tend to use more lethal methods, such as firearms, hanging, or jumping from heights with 42% of completed youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  being \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  contagion related. Harassment is a leading cause of teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , along with the abuse. Teenagers are indefensible to the threat of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  due to increased stress from school and work. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate among young teens and young adults has increased by more than 300% in the last three decades, increased incidence of childhood depression and decreased family stability are some social and personal changes which can increase the desire to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts among youth is not because of only one or two reasons, there are numbers of reason which are the many factors that trigger the suicidal behavior among young girls and boys. And the parents' role is an important in creating or comprising such behavior. Minimizing this is very important and it is possible, through the coordinated actions of parents, peers, school personnel, and the community at large, to reverse the growing trend of teenage \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

First of all, I would like to discuss that why \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts are becoming more and more common among youth. The reasons behind a teen's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be complex. Although \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is relatively rare among children, the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts increases tremendously during adolescence. The risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  increases dramatically when kids and teens have access to firearms at home. That's why any gun in your home should be unloaded, locked, and kept out of the reach of children and teens. While any child or adolescent can develop suicidal thoughts or behavior, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is an especially significant risk for young people who are facing: depression, substance abuse, problems with disruptive or aggressive behaviors. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates differ between boys and girls. Girls think about and attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  about twice as often as boys, and tend to attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by overdosing on drugs or cutting themselves. Yet boys die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  about four times as often as girls, perhaps because they tend to use more lethal methods, such as firearms, hanging, or jumping from heights with 42% of completed youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  being \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  contagion related. Harassment is a leading cause of teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , along with the abuse. Teenagers are indefensible to the threat of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  due to increased stress from school and work. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate among young teens and young adults has increased by more than 300% in the last three decades, increased incidence of childhood depression and decreased family stability are some social and personal changes which can increase the desire to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts among youth is not because of only one or two reasons, there are numbers of reason which are the many factors that trigger the suicidal behavior among young girls and boys. And the parents' role is an important in creating or comprising such behavior. Minimizing this is very important and it is possible, through the coordinated actions of parents, peers, school personnel, and the community at large, to reverse the growing trend of teenage \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Bristol University research into \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  supports the importance of social policy measures in improving mental health.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Researchers in the department of social medicine examined local rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and of hospital admissions for attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and psychiatric illness over a number of years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Between 1982 and 1991, nearly 1,000 people in Bristol committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and there were almost 1,500 attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a year, rates which are comparable to other parts of the country. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The highest rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and psychiatric illness were in Bristol's inner city, and the research published in the latest British Medical Journal suggests a strong link between areas of poverty and the incidence of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Higher proportions of people living in poorer areas than in more affluent neighbourhoods have mental illness which requires hospital admission.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The university research team, led by David Gunnell, lecturer in public health medicine and epidemiology, and Tim Peters, senior lecturer in medical statistics, says that attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is more common among women and younger people, while \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is more common among men, with the highest rates among the over-75 age group. Attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is ten to 20 times higher than \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  There has been a great deal of debate about the relation between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but the Bristol team found a strong link between the two, in that areas with high death rates from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  also had high admission rates for attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The researchers say the link exists despite differences in age and sex and is partially explained by socioeconomic deprivation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  There has been an alarming increase in the number of young men committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  over the past 15 years, and the Government's White Paper, Health of the Nation, has set targets to reduce the number of cases.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  'Social policy and Government measures to reduce socioeconomic deprivation may be as important in realising the Health of the Nation targets as health service activities,' says the report.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to local Lifeline trainer and telephone crisis support supervisor Lyn Anderson, the phrase "committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " perpetuates the stigma toward and judgment of the tragic event. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We associate the word "~committed with' crime and sin - one also can be "~committed' to a mental health facility," Lyn said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Many advocates in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention and bereavement, along with social researchers, are promoting a more sensitive and respectful language around \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "At presentations and workshops we talk about the language of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," Lyn said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Through education, we hope we can purge our language of phrases like "~commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide'\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , "~successful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide'\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , "~failed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt' or "~completed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide'\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The terms successful or failed should never be associated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Typically, when we complete something we feel good - that feeling should not be associated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What words are more sensitive and respectful and less judgmental? 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We can choose to say "~died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide'\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or there was a "~\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt' - such phrases are void of judgment and lessen the stigma associated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," Lyn said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is estimated each year more than 300,000 Australians are touched in some way by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 from Simon Cooke, history department, University of Melbourne.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Your editorial (27/10, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 : A Public Problem) is valuable for the attention it draws to the painful fact of death by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but you overestimate the novelty of the problem. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Official statistics kept in Victoria allow us to calculate the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate as far back as 1857. These figures show that, while youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was rare in the 19th century, the total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate was not appreciably lower than it is today.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nor has concern over the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate been confined to recent years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the 19th century, statisticians interested in "moral statistics" (where \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was once categorised) pointed to rising \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in some countries as proof that these societies were in decay.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 1911, G.H. Knibbs, the Australian Commonwealth statistician, found it "remarkable" that Australian \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates should "greatly exceed" those of the United Kingdom. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has never been restricted to "gloomy, complex northern civilisations" as you suggest. At the time Knibbs wrote, others were also concerned that Australian \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  pointed to degeneration among the Australian population.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 You rightly point to the need for research into the cultural, social, and economic aspects of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The study of the history of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at different times and in different cultures can tell us not only the conditions under which \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates rise and fall, but also how societies have understood and responded to the "ultimately unfathomable" (as you put it) act of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In understanding the different meanings that have been given to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , we will be enriched in our understanding of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in our own times, and relieved of the burden of thinking it unique to our society.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  increased to 134,799 in 2013 from 110,851 in 2003, said the National Crime Record Bureau report titled Crime in India 2013, Times of India reported.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The population has increased by 15 percent during the decade while the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has increased by 5.7 percent in 2013 over 2003 (from 10.4 percent in 2003 to 11 percent in 2013), hence showing a mixed trend in incidents of rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  during the decade, it said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The highest incidents of 16,622 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were reported from Maharashtra in 2013, followed by 16,601 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Tamil Nadu. Both account for 12.3 percent each of the total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Andhra Pradesh (14,607 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides)\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , West Bengal (13,055 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides)\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Karnataka (11,266 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides)\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  accounted for respectively 10.8 percent, 9.7 percent and 8.4 percent of the total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reported in the country, said the report.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These five states together accounted for 53.5 percent of the total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reported in the country. The remaining 46.5 percent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were reported from the rest of the 23 states and seven union territories.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Among the 53 mega cities, Chennai tops the list by witnessing 2,450 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases in 2013, followed by Bangalore 2,033, Delhi 1,753 and Mumbai 1,322 cases.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These four metro cities have contributed more than 35 percent of the total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reported from 53 cities, it said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report attributed family problems and illness to be the main reasons for committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  The two reasons account for 24 percent and 19.6 percent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  out of the total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0   Unemployment, debt and drug abuse are the other factors that compel a person to take one's life.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 SUICIDE\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is one of the greatest public health problems facing Australia today, particularly in rural areas -where population levels and job opportunities are decreasing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  During the last decade one of the most notable increases in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  mortality has been in smaller rural towns with populations of less than 4000. Bundanoon has a population of 1500.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  especially has became the focus of national concern since World Health Organisation figures revealed Australia has one of the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates among young men in the western world.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Australia's male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is seven times higher than that of women. Men tend to use more lethal forms of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , including use of firearms, and have greater "success". Between 1983 and 1994 there were 22,372 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Australia, with male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  accounting for 78 per cent of those \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Researchers say \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  resulting in death are a small proportion of the overall number of attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that occur in Australia each year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In 1995, about 2500 Australians died from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  while a suspected 250,000 attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In the early 1960s, the rate for young male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was about 5 per 100,000 in small country towns. In 1991, in small towns it had risen to 60 per 100,000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It's suspected that some fatal single passenger car accidents involving young males are \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The public health bill for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is calculated to cost the community $1 billion a year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The main causes of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are alcohol and drug abuse, loneliness, family breakdown and an inability to seek help when facing problems.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 PUNE: Most people in the city who take the extreme decision to end their lives are below the age of 30 years and 'family problems' account for a large number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , even in the state, reveals a report of the National Crime Records Bureau. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The NCRB report, released earlier this year, is based on the statistics of accidental deaths and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2011. According to the report, there were 675 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Pune in 2011 (in 2010, the number was 646). Among them, 465 were males and 210 females.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Of the 675 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths, 183 occurred due to family problems, the report says. The next major cause was illness. As many as 153 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were due to illnesses.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per one lakh population is accepted as the yardstick for determining \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate of a city. With 675 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in a population of 50.5 lakh last year, Pune was ranked 18th in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Pune, of the 675 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths in 2011, 312 were in the age-group of 15 to 29 years. Ten youngsters in the age-group of 14 years or less committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  last year.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  due to drug abuse is also one of the major causes.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The trend of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is on a sharp rise in Pakistan, as 751 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases were recorded from January to June 2012, says Madadgaar National Helpline here Saturday.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , a criminal offence and a major mental health problem has destructive effects on individuals, families and communities. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Madadgaar National helpline, sharing its report on the data of on the eve of the World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, said 751 cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were reported from January to June, 2012 across Pakistan. In these six months 136 children, 303 women and 312 male committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Then report said as many as 32762 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the country during the last 12 years (2001-12). The victims include 4031 children, 11752 women and 16975 males.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report is compiled from the data published in national, local newspapers. However, a number of cases are also unreported, as families are reluctant to register cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  because they consider it a social stigma. Men are more likely to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as the data shows.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It seems strong association between poor socio-economic conditions and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Pakistan. Domestic violence, poverty, insecurity, and hopelessness are the most common reasons of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Whereas, poisoning, firearms, hanging, excess use of medicines or sleeping pills, use of insecticides and jumping from height are most common methods of committing and attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Zia Ahmed Awan, President Lawyers for Human Rights and Legal Aid (LHRLA) regretted the rising incidents of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . He said the lack of basic civic facilities, dearth of resources, poorly established healthcare services and political instability make \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention an alarming challenge in Pakistan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Awan said, under Section 325Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), attempt to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is punishable with simple imprisonment for a term of one year or with fine or both. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is condemned act in Islam, as well. Traditionally, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases in Islamic societies remained very low but recently we see a sharp rise in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases, which has become a major problem in Pakistan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said collective efforts of families, civil society, government, media, law enforcement agencies, healthcare and other related department are needed in reducing the incidence of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is a dire need to develop and implement community-based \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention program. A National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Statistics should be compiled at government level. Government needs to develop policy frameworks for chalking out \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategies.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said media can play a vital role in preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . There is dire need to convey people who want to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to choose something other than ending their life to solve their problems.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   The trend of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is on a sharp rise in Pakistan, as 751 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases were recorded from January to June 2012, says Madadgaar National Helpline here Saturday.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , a criminal offence and a major mental health problem has destructive effects on individuals, families and communities. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Madadgaar National helpline, sharing its report on the data of on the eve of the World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, said 751 cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were reported from January to June, 2012 across Pakistan. In these six months 136 children, 303 women and 312 male committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Then report said as many as 32762 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the country during the last 12 years (2001-12). The victims include 4031 children, 11752 women and 16975 males. The report is compiled from the data published in national, local newspapers. However, a number of cases are also unreported, as families are reluctant to register cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  because they consider it a social stigma. Men are more likely to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as the data shows.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It seems strong association between poor socio-economic conditions and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Pakistan. Domestic violence, poverty, insecurity, and hopelessness are the most common reasons of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Whereas, poisoning, firearms, hanging, excess use of medicines or sleeping pills, use of insecticides and jumping from height are most common methods of committing and attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Zia Ahmed Awan, President Lawyers for Human Rights and Legal Aid (LHRLA) regretted the rising incidents of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . He said the lack of basic civic facilities, dearth of resources, poorly established healthcare services and political instability make \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention an alarming challenge in Pakistan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Awan said, under Section 325Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), attempt to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is punishable with simple imprisonment for a term of one year or with fine or both. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is condemned act in Islam, as well. Traditionally, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases in Islamic societies remained very low but recently we see a sharp rise in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases, which has become a major problem in Pakistan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said collective efforts of families, civil society, government, media, law enforcement agencies, healthcare and other related department are needed in reducing the incidence of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . There is a dire need to develop and implement community-based \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention program. A National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Statistics should be compiled at government level. Government needs to develop policy frameworks for chalking out \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategies.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said media can play a vital role in preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . There is dire need to convey people who want to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to choose something other than ending their life to solve their problems.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is now one of the three leading causes of deaths among males and females aged 15-44 years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Australia is recognised as having one of the highest ratios of male-to-female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  (approximately 4:1) compared with other countries.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Each year in WA more than 200 people die from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and an even greater number harm themselves in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Coroner's database reveals that men most at risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are aged 2034 years and 75 years and over, Aboriginal, living in rural and remote areas and in custody. For women, over the past two decades, the highest rates of completed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were those aged 4049 years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The real percentage of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among car accidents is not reliably known. Studies by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  researchers suggest that vehicular fatalities that are \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  vary from 1.6 to 5 per cent.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has a profound effect on the family and friends of the deceased. Research suggests that family and friends who are bereaved by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are at a two to five-fold higher risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  compared to the general population. (ARBOR provides an outreach service for family and friends who lose a loved one by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Referrals can be made by calling 9263 2050).
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is believed to have been uncommon among Aboriginal communities in pre-colonial times. Since the late 1970s, the rising incidence of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and other self-inflicted injuries has become a serious issue. From 1986 to 2006, 304 Aboriginal \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were recorded in WA. Of these \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , 261 were men and 43 were women. The emergence of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  clusters in Aboriginal communities is of particular concern.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  clustering refers to a number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts which occur closer together in time or location than would be expected statistically for that community, according to Lifeline WA chief executive Amanda Wheeler. It appears to particularly affect young and vulnerable people. Clusters may occur due to socio-economic factors or may be related to a traumatic event in the community that has a flow-on effect for vulnerable people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Social contagion is one factor which may lead to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  clustering and it is the concept that a combination of grief, over-identification and fixation on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  leads to an increase in suicidal behaviour among a group of people who have been exposed to a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , said Ms Wheeler. She said the media played an important part in social contagion because it was a means of transmitting or moderating the information which may lead to contagion and communicating information that may help keep people safe.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 TEENAGERS are just 'two clicks' away from finding help to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on the internet, warn doctors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Websites promoting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are easier and quicker to access than those which aim to prevent it, according to research.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the first study of its kind, a quick web search found half of 'hits' brought up details on methods of committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  while one in five were for 'dedicated \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites'.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There has been growing concern about the proliferation of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites, with some claiming to have facilitated \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  pacts among strangers who met and planned their deaths on the internet. Controversy followed a series of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by teenagers and young adults in Bridgend, South Wales, many of whom used networking sites, despite a lack of police evidence of internet involvement. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites are not illegal in Britain, unlike Australia, although campaigners argue they have been a factor in at least 30 cases of young \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the UK in the past six years. The latest study by five doctors and epidemiologists at universities in Bristol, Manchester and Oxford is published today in the British Medical Journal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Professor David Gunnell, professor of epidemiology at Bristol University's department of social medicine, said the internet made it simple for youngsters seeking information about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said: 'We were surprised by the frequency with which the same pro-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites came up across four search engines and the evaluation of methods provided. There was detailed information about speed, certainty and the likely amount of pain associated with a method.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 'It would only take a couple of clicks to get to these sites once you've put simple words into the search.' The research team searched the internet last May for sites providing instructions and information on methods of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . They used Google, Yahoo, MSN and Ask15 to search the entire web, not just UK sites.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The researchers selected 12 terms that were entered into each search engine in turn. The first ten hits retrieved by each search were then analysed, with a total of 240 sites identified and 480 hits reviewed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The terms used were: \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  methods; \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sure methods; most effective methods of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; methods of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; ways to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; how to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; how to kill yourself; easy \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  methods; best \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  methods; pain-free \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and quick \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Just under a fifth of hits, 90, were for dedicated \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites. Half of these were judged to be encouraging, promoting, or facilitating \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  while 43 contained personal or other accounts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  methods, providing information and discussing pros and cons but without direct encouragement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Two sites portrayed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or self harm in 'fashionable' terms.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sites focusing on preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or offering support accounted for 62 hits (13 per cent). Sites forbidding or discouraging \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  accounted for 59 (12 per cent).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Chat rooms may exert 'peer pressure to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , idolise those who have completed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and facilitate \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  pacts', warned the 'Portrayed in fashionable terms' study. However, some sites enable searchers to share their distress and learn new coping strategies.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates among the young have been declining since the 1990s - while internet use has expanded - but Professor Gunnell said there was a danger this might not continue.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said the Government should look at whether \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites should be made illegal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Another possible solution was to ensure that sites which support youngsters during a crisis came higher up the search ranking.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "tried' by 40,000 each year MELBOURNE: More than 40,000 Australians attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year, research by a welfare group has found. The Sydney City Mission yesterday said that Australia's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate was a staggering 300 percent higher than in Britain and 30 percent higher than in Japan. The group said a young Australian committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every day. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate for males aged between 15 and 19 had more than doubled in 20 years. Statistics Bureau figures show that, apart from road accidents, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the biggest killer of young Australian males. The City Mission has organised a conference on youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention titled ""Hearing The Cry" in Sydney on December 12-13. A \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  researcher and secretary of Australian National Lifeline, Ms Margaret Appleby, said Australia's ""she'll be right" attitude contributed to the nation's increasing incidence of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . ""We've got to dispel the myths about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," Ms Appleby said. ""People don't take it seriously. ""They think that if someone talks about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  they won't do it but nine out of 10 people tell us they are going to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the public doesn't know what to do about it. ""People need to know it's okay to talk about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  _ it's not contagious." Ms Appleby, who has also written a book about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, said prevention programs should be compulsory in schools as they were in the United States. ""Seventy percent of people who complete \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have tried it once or more before," Ms Appleby said. She said rural areas had a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate up to six times greater than the cities. Women attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  more than men but men committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  more than women, she said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One of the first questions which we ask is 'why'. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We look for a simple reason.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Today, six heartbroken families and their communities will be desperately asking why these girls could be driven to end their young lives in such a harrowing manner. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But there is never a simple answer to this most difficult question.   
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The reasons why a person ends their life are most complex and there are always many underlying causes.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Those who are in such personal crisis that they see no other solution than to end their lives are not intent in doing so but do not see any other way to deal with their mental anguish and pain.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is important to be careful not to inadvertently romanticise \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or idealise those who take their own lives and we must be careful not to portray \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as a heroic or romantic act.  
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is neither a cowardly nor brave act. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is the act of a person in deep crisis and in many cases the outcome of the failure of State services to respond to the need for help.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is evidence that excessive publicity of actual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  does increase copycat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For example, in the 1970s, during the 12-month period following international publicity of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by burning, there were 60 more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from burning in Britain than would normally be expected. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is accepted there is an increase when media reports of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  increase, or when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is treated prominently -- on the front page of a newspaper or at the beginning of a broadcast.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The effect of copycat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the wake of celebrity \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has been extensively researched.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Celebrity \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are more likely to produce imitation due to the prominence of those involved and the respect that they receive. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Young people especially identify with a celebrity as a role model.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Celebrity \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  also receives considerable media coverage following the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  death of a famous person. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, the expected rise in copycat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among his local fans following the death of noted pop singer Kurt Cobain, the lead singer of the rock band Nirvana in Seattle in 1994 did not occur. This was thought to be due to the sensitive reporting of the event.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This did not glamourise the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as a tragic waste of a talented life.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There was close cooperation between the local health authorities and the media.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In addition to the reporting of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the media published the telephone details of a number of helplines and agencies that offer support to vulnerable persons.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The number of calls to these services increased dramatically in subsequent days and weeks and the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate reduced. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is a powerful role to be played by the media in educating the public about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This can the form of articles or broadcast material which informs the public about the: 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  likely causes of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; its warning signs;  trends in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates; and recent advances in dealing with the underlying causes. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Opportunities to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can also be highlighted. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We must never forget that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a terrible act against nature, causes desperate trauma to the bereaved family and community and must never be considered as a solution to any problem under any circumstances.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 PUNE: Family problems, unemployment, failure in examinations, poverty and dowry disputes are reasons for people succumbing to the urge to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Nagpur, Pune and Nashik are among 20 cities in the country with high \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates, according to the National Crime Records Bureau's data collated between 2005 and 2009. The findings were published in a report - Accidental Deaths and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in India. The data was analysed by the health department and released this month. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nagpur, with the highest number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the state and a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate of 18.4, was ranked 11th in the country. Pune came 12th with 17.3, and Nashik was 16th. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per one lakh population. The report said that social and economic causes led most men to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  whereas emotional and personal
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 causes drove women to end their lives.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The analysis indicated that there were more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the 15-29 age group in Nagpur, Pune and Nashik and that more men committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than women. Pune recorded 648 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the 60 years and above age group as against 390 in Nagpur and 168 in Nashik in 2009.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Prakash Doke, former executive director, State Health Systems Resource Centre said Nagpur has been consistently reporting high \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates. About 14,426 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Maharashtra as against the national count of 1,13,914 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2005. In 2009, there were 14,300 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Maharashtra against the country's count of 1,27,151. The analysis also showed that Maharashtra ranked 13th, accounting for 11.2% of total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the country with a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate of 13.2. Bangalore topped the list followed by Chennai.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    The government and civil associations on Thursday announced guidelines for media reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in an effort to prevent further growth of the national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The guideline came after research indicated that press reports on high-profile \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases trigger copycat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  However, some doubt the effectiveness of the measure, as it is just a proposed guideline and not compulsoryKorea Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention, Journalists Association of Korea, and the Health and Welfare Ministry jointly announced a guideline for press reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and recommended journalists follow the guideline. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The government has decided to propose the instruction following research that news, movies or novels on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have the Werther effect, which incites people to commit copycat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The term Werther effect was coined in the 18th century when many young people took their lives after reading the novel ''The Sorrows of Young Werther.''Many advanced countries such as the United States, Japan, Australia, and Canada have adopted such guidelines.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The number of people committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has sharply increased in South Korea in a few years, due to extreme stress mainly from economic difficulties and family collapse. It is suspected that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by influential people and the way media report such \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are another factor encouraging \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reports remind those wanting to escape hardship and difficulties that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is an option. Media reports need to be more cautious,'' Lee Young-tae, editor of Media Today, told The Korea Times.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The guideline suggests journalists protect the privacy of those who commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or their families and avoid describing details of the place and method of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unless it is a famous figure the public should know about. It also urged media not to deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases as a scoop or a means of drawing public interest.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Journalists are also advised to notify people of the negative impact of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as well as information that can prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The guideline also urges media not to embellish or justify \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ''Famous figures who recently took their lives were facing punishment due to illegal behavior. Their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was a means of evading punishment, so such \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  should not be justified,'' a staff of the journalists association said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, as the guideline is not a rule and has no legal binding, whether to follow it or not is totally up to media people themselves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''It is difficult to limit what kind of details should not be disclosed or included in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reports, or whose \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be regarded as that of a public figure. The judgment should be made by journalists' conscience,'' a ministry official said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''The guideline will be an opportunity for media to consider how to report \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases,'' Lee of Media Today said.

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 KARACHI, Sept. 9 -- The trend of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is on a sharp rise in Pakistan, as 751 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases were recorded from January to June 2012, says Madadgaar National Helpline here Saturday. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , a criminal offence and a major mental health problem has destructive effects on individuals, families and communities.Madadgaar National helpline, sharing its report on the data of on the eve of the World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, said 751 cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were reported from January to June, 2012 across Pakistan.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In these six months 136 children, 303 women and 312 male committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Then report said as many as 32762 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the country during the last 12 years (2001-12). The victims include 4031 children, 11752 women and 16975 males. The report is compiled from the data published in national, local newspapers. However, a number of cases are also unreported, as families are reluctant to register cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  because they consider it a social stigma. Men are more likely to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as the data shows.It seems strong association between poor socio-economic conditions and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Pakistan. Domestic violence, poverty, insecurity, and hopelessness are the most common reasons of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Whereas, poisoning, firearms, hanging, excess use of medicines or sleeping pills, use of insecticides and jumping from height are most common methods of committing and attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Zia Ahmed Awan, President Lawyers for Human Rights and Legal Aid (LHRLA) regretted the rising incidents of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . He said the lack of basic civic facilities, dearth of resources, poorly established healthcare services and political instability make \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention an alarming challenge in Pakistan. Awan said, under Section 325Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), attempt to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is punishable with simple imprisonment for a term of one year or with fine or both. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is condemned act in Islam, as well. Traditionally, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases in Islamic societies remained very low but recently we see a sharp rise in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases, which has become a major problem in Pakistan.He said collective efforts of families, civil society, government, media, law enforcement agencies, healthcare and other related department are needed in reducing the incidence of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . There is a dire need to develop and implement community-based \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention program. A National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Statistics should be compiled at government level.

There is dire need to convey people who want to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to choose something other than ending their life to solve their problems.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Is \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  genetic?- Wondering in Bedford
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 - \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has many complex causes. It is hardly ever caused by one factor.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Genetics of some diseases is clear. This is not the case with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . There is no \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  gene. But genetics may have an effect. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The effect of genetics on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are due to inheriting mental illness and inheriting traits. Several mental illnesses have genetic influences and increase the risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . These include depression, bipolar disease, schizophrenia, and some types of anxiety. None of these mental illnesses are entirely genetic; they also are due to the environment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The science is still in its early stages. We don't have a clear understanding of the genetics of mental illness.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is also influenced by traits that are partly genetic. Pessimism or always looking at the negative things is caused partly by genetics. Feeling hopeless is also important. The genetics of pessimism and hopelessness are not clear but there seems to be a genetic aspect of these traits.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Being impulsively aggressive is related to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Someone who lashes out without thinking has more risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . This trait is partly genetic.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sometimes genes cause specific things. Genes cause eye colour. Genes cause sickle cell disease and cystic fibrosis. If your parents give you the wrong genes, you will have one of these diseases.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This is not true with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Having all the genetic risk factors for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  does not mean a person will commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is never specifically caused by genes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Having a parent who committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a serious burden. It increases risk of depression and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . However, much of the increased risk is not genetic but because of having to cope with this trauma. However, most children who have a parent who committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  learn to deal with it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is an important cause of death, it really is quite rare. Statistics Canada reports that, in adolescents aged 15 to 18, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is about 20 per 100,000 for males and just over four per 100,000 for girls. But that means that 99,980 out of 100,000 boys and 99,995 out of 100,000 girls do not commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a terrible tragedy when it occurs. Getting help can prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Talking to someone who cares is important. For some, a religious counsellor or a teacher can help. Many teens can talk to their parents or a close friend. Your school's teen health centre is there to help. There are lots of other sources of help. Some are:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Metro Help Line at 902-421-1188.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Yesterday marked the 10th anniversary of World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, a day when people are encouraged to discuss solutions to what's becoming an almost epidemic mental health issue among our young people. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to Children's Mental Health Ontario (CMHO), \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the second leading cause of death among 10- to 24-year-olds in Canada.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Untreated mental illness - depression, in particular - is the leading risk factor for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For every \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  completion, there are thousands more young people having thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , according to the CMHO.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One recent study found one in 10 students in Grades 7 to 12 reported they had seriously considered \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and about three per cent reported attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among Aboriginal youth is estimated to occur at rates five times higher than non-Aboriginal youth.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To mark World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, the Halton \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Coalition and Talking About Addictions and Mental Health will co-host a community forum on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  this Thursday at Craig Kielburger Secondary School.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The forum, from 7 to 10 p.m., is being held to help break the stigma associated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , help people talk openly about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and show how everyone has a role to play in its prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Shame is one of the most challenging and prominent feelings around \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The stigma associated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  often prevents those suffering from getting help.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Early intervention remains critical to young people having the best possible chance at succeeding in all aspects of their life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 No doubt this Thursday's forum will provide vital information on how we can all help break the barriers and prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The trend of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is on the rise in Pakistan, as 751 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases were reported from January to June 2012, says Madadgaar National Helpline here on Saturday.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , a criminal offence and a major mental health problem has destructive effects on individuals, families and communities. Madadgaar National helpline, sharing its report on the data of on the eve of the World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, said that 751 cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were reported from January to June, 2012 throughout Pakistan. In these six months 136 children, 303 women and 312 males committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Then report said as many as 32762 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the country during the last 12 years (2001-12). The victims include 4031 children, 11752 women and 16975 males. The report is compiled from the data published in national, local newspapers. However, a number of cases are also unreported, as families are reluctant to register cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  because they consider it a social stigma. Men are more likely to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as the data shows. It seems strong association between poor socio-economic conditions and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Pakistan. Domestic violence, poverty, insecurity, and hopelessness are the most common reasons of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Whereas, poisoning, firearms, hanging, excess use of medicines or sleeping pills, use of insecticides and jumping from height are most common methods of committing and attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Zia Ahmed Awan, President Lawyers for Human Rights and Legal Aid (LHRLA) regretted the rising incidents of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . He said the lack of basic civic facilities, dearth of resources, poorly established healthcare services and political instability make \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention an alarming challenge in Pakistan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Awan said, under Section 325Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), attempt to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is punishable with simple imprisonment for a term of one year or with fine or both. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is condemned act in Islam, as well. Traditionally, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases in Islamic societies remained very low but recently we see a sharp rise in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases, which has become a major problem in Pakistan. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said collective efforts of families, civil society, government, media, law enforcement agencies, healthcare and other related department are needed in reducing the incidence of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . There is a dire need to develop and implement community-based \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention program. A National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Statistics should be compiled at government level. Government needs to develop policy frameworks for chalking out \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategies. He said media can play a vital role in preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . There is dire need to convey people who want to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to choose something other than ending their life to solve their problems.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 New Delhi, July 3 --  Over 100,000 people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in India every year on an average. The number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the past decade has recorded an increase of 21.6 percent, said a government report.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  increased to 134,799 in 2013 from 110,851 in 2003, said the National Crime Record Bureau report titled Crime in India, 2013, released here this week.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The report showed that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate has declined in the country after 2011.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The population has increased by 15 percent during the decade while the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has increased by 5.7 percent in 2013 over 2003 (from 10.4 percent in 2003 to 11 percent in 2013), hence showing a mixed trend in incidents of rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  during the decade, it said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The highest incidents of 16,622 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were reported from Maharashtra in 2013, followed by 16,601 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Tamil Nadu. Both account for 12.3 percent each of the total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Andhra Pradesh (14,607 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ), West Bengal (13,055 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ) and Karnataka (11,266 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ) accounted for respectively 10.8 percent, 9.7 percent and 8.4 percent of the total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reported in the country, said the report.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  These five states together accounted for 53.5 percent of the total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reported in the country. The remaining 46.5 percent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were reported from the rest of the 23 states and seven union territories.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Among the 53 mega cities, Chennai tops the list by witnessing 2,450 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases in 2013, followed by Bangalore 2,033, Delhi 1,753 and Mumbai 1,322 cases.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  These four metro cities have contributed more than 35 percent of the total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reported from 53 cities, it said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The report attributed family problems and illness to be the main reasons for committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The two reasons account for 24 percent and 19.6 percent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  out of the total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Unemployment, debt and drug abuse are the other factors that compel a person to take one's life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It pointed out that the number of married men (64,098) committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2012 was double the married women (29,491).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "The incidence of married men committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  mainly due to family stress is on the rise," Child Rights Initiative for Shared Parenting (CRISP) president Kumar V. Jahgirdar told   Thursday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Studies conducted by the CRISP said the married men committed  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  mainly due to alleged misuse of Section 498 (A) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Domestic Violence Act of 2005.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Section 498 (A) deals with harassing a married woman.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We are demanding setting up of national commission for men on the lines of the National Commission of Women to look into the problems faced by the married men," Jahgirdar added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "When a married man faces the domestic violence in the form of verbal abuse, mental abuse and economical abuse, there is no provision in law to seek justice," said Save Family Foundation-Delhi founder member Swarup Sarkar. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  On the analogy of the Lokpal Act, which has a special clause to punish those who misuse the law, there should a law to check misuse of Section 498 (A) and the domestic violence act, he added.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ARE you having suicidal thoughts? It's a question none of us want to ask but a new program in the region is renewing calls for locals to be open about the realities of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a rural community the right help is not always available, however safeTALK is designed to teach everyday people to become more alert to prevention opportunities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Yesterday, Gaynor Hicks of the National Centre for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention and Training met with members of the Warwick \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Group. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Johno Felton organised Mrs Hicks' visit "because she is one of the best \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  educators in the world".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There was another \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the region at the weekend," Mr Felton said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Those who want to help now have the opportunity to get training to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We've got to get people talking about the issue so they can learn to be alert to the signs."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SafeTALK is training that prepares anyone over the age of 15 to identify people with thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and connect them to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  first aid resources. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Most people with thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  invite help to stay safe. Alert helpers know how to use these opportunities to support that desire for safety. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If you become a safeTALK-trained \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  alert helper, you will be better able to move beyond common tendencies to miss, dismiss or avoid \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and identify people who have thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 You'll also be able to apply the TALK steps (Tell, Ask, Listen and KeepSafe) to connect a person with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  thoughts to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  first aid.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mrs Hicks said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be prevented.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are dangerous and they really need to be taken seriously," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There are a lot of signs people are missing when it comes to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "These include certain behaviours, actions, withdrawing from normal activity."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mrs Hicks said asking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be as hard as someone asking for help.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There's a lot of stigma about not talking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Some people think it's a topic to be left untouched. But we need to be more open about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to prevent it."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mrs Hicks said if you have someone close to you who is having suicidal thoughts or has even made an attempt it's not the time to be drilling for answers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's confusing; you often wonder do they really want to die? Will they do it again? What can I do?" 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "You really need to let them know that you are going to support them," Mrs Hicks said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Listen to what they have to say and how their mental outlook may be affecting their well-being. If you don't think you can help them, find someone who can."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kicking off next Wednesday will be the first monthly healing meeting organised by the Mayan Maruma-li Indigenous support group.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Organiser Joanne Wallace said while it was aimed at Indigenous people, everyone was more than welcome to head along.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The first meeting will be in Allora from 10am at the hall in Warwick St," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's designed to get people talking and basically making sure everyone is OK.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We hope to see the group move around the district on a monthly basis."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Social worker Leonie Hobson said the program was overdue for our region.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's absolutely fantastic and definitely an area that had previously been untapped in our region," she said. "It's meeting a new need and it's really good to see."
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If you or someone you know needs immediate help phone Lifeline on 131114. For more information on the monthly healing meeting phone Joanne on 46664156 or email safetalk@livingworks.net\b0 \i0 \ul0

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Monday (Sept. 10) marked the 10th anniversary of World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, a day when people are encouraged to discuss solutions to what is becoming a prevalent mental-health issue among our young people. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to Children's Mental Health Ontario (CMHO), \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the second leading cause of death among 10-24 year olds in Canada.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Untreated mental illness - depression, in particular - is the leading risk factor for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For every \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  completion, there are thousands more young people having thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , according to the CMHO.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One recent study found one in 10 students in Grades 7-12 reported they had seriously considered \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and about three per cent reported attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Among Aboriginal youth, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is estimated to occur at rates five times higher than non-Aboriginal youth.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In keeping with the theme of this year's World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day in Ontario, "All Together - Promoting Hope and Resiliency," the CMHO joined with the Canadian Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention to encourage communities across the province to get involved by showing their support for people affected by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and promote a collaborative approach to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While support can be expressed many ways, the gift of non-judgmental support is of utmost importance.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Shame is one of the most challenging and prominent feelings around \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The stigma associated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  often prevents those suffering from getting help.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One-in-five children and youth has a mental-health issue severe enough to seriously affect their daily functioning at home, school or within the community.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Early intervention remains critical to young people having the best possible chance at succeeding in all aspects of their life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The community-based organization Distress Centre Oakville has been providing support to individuals 24 hours a day, seven days a week since 1974 and helped people to better cope with - to contact the centre, call 905-849-4541 or visit www.distresscentreoakville.com .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One-in-five children and youth has a mental health issue severe enough to seriously affect their daily functioning at home, school or within the community. The importance of early intervention is critical so that young persons have the best possible chance at succeeding in all aspects of their life.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Alarmed by increasing cases of assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and contract killing through Internet sites, the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency (SMPA) launched a crackdown on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A spokesman said the police will seek out, manage and collect information on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -related sites during the crackdown period that will continue for a month.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The target of the control will be sites that encourage, assist \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or provide information on contract killing, those with messages that instigate \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or introduce \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  methods, and anti-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites that, in the end, contribute to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The police also plan to severely punish netizens who have been involved in illegal anti-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites or sites that incite or assist \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and immediately close down these sites. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It sent out letters issued by the police chief to Internet portal service operators, asking them to delete \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -related messages on their boards.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The cyber crime investigation team of SMPA said that it is aware of the fact that there are three to four anti-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites and that they are abused as places for exchanging information on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, there are no laws that force the sites to be closed down nor punish the operators, an SMPA official said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, advocates and opponents are staging a heated debate on whether to close down anti-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites after it was revealed that three people who committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  last week met through one of these sites.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Advocates of the anti-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites say that the sites should be allowed on the Net since the sites intend to give hopes on life to those who have determined \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On the other hand, the opponents argue the anti-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites are being abused as a means of promoting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In fact, the three who committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  last Friday met through an anti-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  site established by a psychiatrist who intended to console and give courage to those who were thinking of killing themselves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A man, whose family name is Kim, 34, and two high school girls, whose last names are Cha, 16, and Cho, 15, leaped off an apartment building in Seoul. Another man whose last name is Kim, 26, was later found that he aided the three take their lives by planning the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  method with them and taking them in his car to the apartment where they jumped.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Song, 25, a male college student, also tried to kill himself but in vain last Friday by taking poison on a bridge in Seoul. Kim and Song said they got acquainted with the deceased Kim through the anti-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  site.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Since the triple \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , netizens have posted hundreds of messages on the anti-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  site in question, inquiring ways to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and seeking for people to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with them.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Opponents of the anti-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites posted messages on various Internet bulletin boards, insisting that the sites be abolished.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One netizen with an ID of "Let's live" said that anti-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites should be eradicated immediately to prevent other victims. "Anti-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites are becoming the hotbed of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  contrary to its purpose of preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," the author wrote.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Another netizen pointed out, "Although there are several anti-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites, most of them have fallen to a place where those who intend to kill themselves exchange information. Other cases of group \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will occur."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But others opposed to shutting down anti-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites, stressing their need.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Although the sites are somewhat abused, they have good functions such as giving hopes and consolations to people who determined to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," said a netizen by the ID of "Giraffe."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Another asked, "We cannot shut down a knife factory because a murder occurred using a knife, can we?"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One operator of an anti-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  site said that due to exploitation, he is closing down some parts of the site such as the chat room. He added that he will devise measures to overcome the adverse effects.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 HIGH \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  numbers in northern Namibia could be linked to unemployment and poverty.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Last week Namibia, which ranks as having one of the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in the world, commemorated World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The day takes place annually to promote worldwide commitment and action to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This year's global \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  awareness day focused on "preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in multicultural societies", with the aim that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention programmes should consider that "multicultural societies require cultural sensitivity in all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention efforts".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 During her keynote address, the Deputy Minister of Health and Social Services, Petrina Haingura, said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is one of the leading causes of death in Namibia. She said statistics also show that "it is on the increase in Namibia".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Namibia, 81 per cent of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2010 were committed by men, mainly by hanging or shooting themselves. Of the total number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  committed by men and women last year, 84 per cent died by hanging and 12 per cent shot themselves. According to experts, for every successful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , there are at least 10 attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Statistics show that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  peaked in the northern regions of the country last year, and according to some, this is linked to high unemployment there.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Windhoek psychologist Shaun Whittaker said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  statistics from 2010 show that the vast majority take place in rural areas of Namibia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police records for 2010 reveal that 17 per cent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  last year took place in the Ohangwena Region. The second highest number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were committed in the Oshana Region - 13 per cent. The Khomas Region, with 9 per cent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , came in third.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to Whittaker, it is significant and "not a coincidence" that the top number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  took place at Okongo in the Ohangwena Region, which has the second highest unemployment rate in the country at 76,4 per cent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Whittaker says while two-thirds of Namibians live in rural regions, Namibia's economic policies "do not consider rural development as a priority".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He says it is vital to investigate the reason for the high, and low, number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the various regions, as the answers could be vital to an intervention strategy.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The police will take aggressive measures against \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  information found on the internet, as a response to the recent series of collective \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The National Police Agency, together with the Ministry for Health, Welfare and Family Affairs and the Korean Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention, started a two-week anti-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  campaign yesterday, said officials. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 During the period, over 1,000 members of Nuri Cops, a group of honorary cyber police officers selected from active internet users, will watch over and delete postings that may incite suicidal impulses. These include invitations to a joint \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and guides on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  methods.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The police will also strike hard on those who run \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  websites, or sell toxic chemicals that may be used as a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  tool, said officials.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Last month, 21 people attempted to commit joint \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and 12 died in the Gangwon Province. Some were found to be members of a major online \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  community. Last Thursday, the police arrested the founder of the website for aiding and abetting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Health Ministry and the KASP will assist the police's anti-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  campaign by distributing visual and audio educational materials in schools all over the country. They will also offer counseling to those who hinted at suicidal intentions on the internet.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 President Lee Myung-bak, during his radio speech yesterday, worried about the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  trend in Korea, especially on the joint \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of people who met through \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  websites. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It is deplorable that such websites should exist at all," said Lee. "A person who has enough determination to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  may be up to surviving any difficulties."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A recent OECD data showed that Korea's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is the highest among all OECD countries. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was also the top-ranking cause of death for Koreans in their 20s, according to the National Statistical Office.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Government policies are insufficient in eradicating harmful online information," said a police official. "Above all, the internet users themselves need to be aware of the dangers found on the internet and cooperate with these campaigns to clean up the cyber space."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pieta House, the community-based \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and self- harm prevention centre, has warned the continuing refusal to properly fund \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention is failing to prevent needless deaths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the organisation, despite 96 recommendations of the Government's Reach Out \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategy, up to 700 people died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  across the state last year. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Official Central Statistics Office figures show during 2007, a total of 460 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were recorded in Ireland.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, citing drownings, single occupant car accidents, "fudged" verdicts by coroners, and research by the National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Research Foundation of Ireland (NSRF) - which indicates that up to 50 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were not recorded last year because the relevant documentation was not filled out by garda\'ed - the organisation has claimed in reality the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  figure is far in excess of official levels.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Approximately two funerals a day occur as a result of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Ireland. The official figures are only based on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  verdicts by coroners, but that doesn't reflect the true number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There are drownings, there are road accidents, there are coroners who do not want to provide a verdict of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but they're not counted because they are not recorded as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's anecdotal evidence, but the real level of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is far higher than what's reported," said Dr Joan Freeman, chief executive of Dublin-based Pieta House, which opened in 2006.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Last year, just EUR 3.05 million was set aside for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and self-harm prevention programmes out of a health service budget of about EUR 15 billion - despite \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates rising by 41% since the mid-1990s.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Criticising the "totally inadequate" \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention funding, Irish Association of Suicidology chairman Dan Neville said vulnerable members of the public are being put at risk.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Fine Gael TD, who is also chair of the Oireachtas health sub-committee on the prevention of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , said: "The true figure is considerably higher than the official figure of 460 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  last year. More people die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than on the roads, but last year \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention programmes received EUR 3.05m in funding and the road accident prevention received EUR 40m.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The road accident funding is essential... but how are we going to reduce the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  if we do not receive adequate funding?"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A HSE spokesperson said while the executive was "keenly aware" of the level of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Ireland, as it is a state body it can only act on official figures detailed by Coroners Court verdicts and subsequently reported by the Central Statistics Office.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 THE Internet has the potential to significantly increase Australia's
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate, a national conference in Hobart heard yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Professor Pierre Baume, of the University of NSW school of psychology,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 said there were now hundreds of thousands of references to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 the Internet, including interactive sites with instructions on how to
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Professor Baume attracted worldwide attention when he completed the
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 first study into \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the Internet. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The study traced the lives of three adolescent males who had
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 publicised their intention to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in a regular series of
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 interactive \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  notes on the Internet.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The three subsequently committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Professor Baume's study found 366,645 references to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on the
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Internet, a number which he said would already have increased.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said when he tried to infiltrate Internet conversations which were
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 encouraging \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , with messages discouraging it, he had been shut
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 out by those controlling the sites.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It takes about half an hour to set up a web page and within that
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 time you could have had one million people visiting your site," he
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's so quick and so powerful and, unlike pornographic material, it
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 is all free."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 State Mental Health manager Mary Blackwood said 13 people had
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Tasmania so far this year, while 63 suicided in
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 the state in 1997.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Of those who committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  last year, 12 were female and 51 male.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Australia, young males were by far the most likely to commit
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with a significantly higher \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate than all other
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 sectors of society.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Professor Baume said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  now accounted for one quarter of all
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 deaths among young Australian males.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The Internet has the potential to have a huge impact on increasing
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates for vulnerable populations," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is now the leading cause of external death in Australia."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 From 1990-95 Professor Baume studied the psychological profiles of
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 3000 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims _ the largest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  study in Australia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said while the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among young women had remained the
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 same between 1960 and 1996, the rate of male youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 quadrupled and showed no sign of decreasing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Professor Baume told yesterday's conference of the Australian and New
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Zealand College of Mental Health Nurses that nurses could influence
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 those at risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  far more than GPs or psychiatrists because
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 nurses could spend far greater time with those at risk.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And he said parents should learn to become Internet literate.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It is commonly accepted that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a social problem and that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention is therefore permissible and desirable.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We are inundated with media reports on the "problem" of youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the "tragedy" of elder \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the "epidemic" of native \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on reserves, the "horror" of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by the handicapped, the "misfortune" of collective \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for religious motives, and the "loss" of all those unfortunate others who are "victims" of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We have conferences organized by concerned interest groups and health professionals on how to detect \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , how to intervene more efficiently, and how to "treat" those who have attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is regarded as an evil, a disease, or a moral transgression. The verb commit is invariably used when talking of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , implying an immoral or illegal act. One commits rape, thievery, or murder. Similarly, we state that one commits \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , which must by extension be wrong, and therefore, must be prevented.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I argue against the prevailing wisdom. I believe \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, the prolongation of another person's suffering, is wicked.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is not a social problem; \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a fundamental human right. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention is oppression. Why? Because the sufferer is prevented from acting as an autonomous agent engaged in self determination.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Those groups that are most active in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention - namely psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, counsellors, therapists and the police - share the value and belief systems of the privileged.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is the haves that prevent the have-nots from dying. It is the healthy, the wealthy, the powerful, the attractive, the loved, the employed and the successful who prevent the sick, the poor, the powerless, the unattractive, the unloved, the unemployed and the unsuccessful from ending their misery.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention would be more acceptable if those who attempted to dissuade others from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  would limit their methods to dialogue.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This is not the case, and the power of the state and the medical establishment is utilized against those wishing to die. Historically, much cruelty has been inflicted upon those who desired death. They have been imprisoned in hospitals, tied to beds or kept in straitjackets, forcibly drugged and involuntarily subjected to electroshock therapy and lobotomy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 All these tortures were masqueraded as treatments.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Even today, people who threaten or attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be sent by the police to hospitals where they are incarcerated, kept under surveillance, pressured into taking drugs and run the risk of being declared mentally incompetent - which would increase the likelihood of receiving unwanted treatment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Yet why should we permit the state, and in particular the mental- health movement, to continue to interfere with our right to take our lives?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What makes \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention so repugnant, in addition to the use of state and psychiatric violence, is its barrenness and self- serving nature.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What can the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  preventer offer that would ameliorate the plight of the suffering individual? Nothing. All that can be given is therapy, which is merely an attempt to alter or manipulate emotions and beliefs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The desperate individual is told to develop self-esteem, that difficulties are exaggerated, that the desire to die is irrational, or that hope is always present.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The objective conditions that provoked the wish to die remain unchanged. But if the do-gooders are unable to do any good, it is presumptuous to offer assistance in the first place.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The trend of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among the people has seen a sharp rise in the first six month of this year. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is considered as a criminal offence, a major mental health problem, and it is a desperate attempt to escape agony that has become awful.  Madadgaar national helpline shared the report about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to mark the world \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention day, as this day is observed on September 10 every year across the world including Pakistan to promote the worldwide commitment and action to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Madadgaar national helpline's database documented total 751 cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  during January to June, 2012, across Pakistan. In these six month as many as 136 children, 303 women and 312 male committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .  As many as 32,762 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  including 4,031 cases of children, 11,752 of women and 16,975 of male were documented across Pakistan during the last 12 years (2001-12). The report shared by the organization has been compiled from the monitoring of different national, local newspapers. However, a number of cases also went unreported, as families are reluctant to register the cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  because they consider \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as social stigma. Men are more likely to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as data showed. It seems strong association between poor socio-economic conditions and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Pakistan. Domestic violence, poverty and loss of control over their lives, insecurity, hopelessness about their future and depression are the most common reason for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Whereas, poisoning, firearm, hanging, excess use of medicines or sleeping pills, use of insecticides and jumping from height are most common methods of committing and attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .  Zia Ahmed Awan, President Lawyers for Human Rights and Legal Aid (LHRLA) regretted over the rising incidents of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . He said it shows that due to the lack of basic facilities, lack of resources, poorly established health services and political instability make \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention an alarming challenge in Pakistan.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The trend of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among the people has seen a sharp rise in the first six month of this year. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is considered as a criminal offence, a major mental health problem and it is a desperate attempt to escape agony that has become awful.  Madadgaar National helpline shared the report about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to mark the World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention day, as this day is observed on 10th September every year across the world including Pakistan to promote the worldwide commitment and action to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Madadgaar National Helpine's Database documented total 751 cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  during January to June, 2012 across Pakistan. In these six month as many as 136 children, 303 women and 312 male committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .  As many as 32762 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , including 4031 cases of children, 11752 of women and 16975 of male were documented across Pakistan during the last 12 years (2001-12). The report shared by the organization has been compiled from the monitoring of different national, local newspapers. However, a number of cases also went unreported, as families are reluctant to register the case as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  because they consider \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as social stigma. Men are more likely to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as data showed. It seems strong association between poor socio-economic conditions and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Pakistan. Domestic violence, poverty and loss of control over their lives, insecurity, hopelessness about their future and depression are the most common reason for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Whereas, poisoning, firearm, hanging, excess use of medicines or sleeping pills, use of insecticides and jumping from height are most common methods of committing and attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .  Zia Ahmed Awan President Lawyers for human rights and legal aid (LHRLA) regretted over the rising incidents of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . He said, it shows that due to the lack of basic facilities provided, lack of resources, poorly established health services and political instability make \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention an alarming challenge in Pakistan.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Grille, Aug. 13 -- The State Of Massachusetts has issued following Press Release:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This is the latest in a series of posts highlighting a chapter from the "Health of Massachusetts", a comprehensive new report from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH). 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a significant, and preventable, public health issue. While the term "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " refers to completed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , it is also important that we recognize the impact of nonfatal self-inflicted injuries such as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts or intentionally cutting or burning oneself.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The MDPH \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Program works to reduce the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts in the Commonwealth. The program employs prevention strategies recommended by the National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Plan, which include increasing public awareness of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as a public health problem, reducing the stigma of help-seeking, depression screening, skills training for mental health, substance abuse and healthcare professionals, gatekeeper training for the general public and services for families and communities after a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occurs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The impact of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is enormous. Experts estimate, very conservatively, that for every \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  there are six loved ones left behind to experience the complicated grief that follows. Along with the sadness that attends any death, most of these survivors also suffer from guilt, feeling that they could have "done something" to prevent the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 MORE than 40,000 Australians try to kill themselves every year, according to a major welfare group.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Sydney City Mission said yesterday that Australia's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate was 300 per cent higher than that in Britain and 30 per cent higher than Japan's.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A spokesman for the mission said that one young Australian committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every day and the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate for males aged between 15 and 19 had more than doubled in the past 20 years. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He added that for every successful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  there were as many as 50 attempted ones.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Bureau of Statistics figures show that, apart from road accidents, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the biggest killer of young Australian males.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  expert Ms Margaret Appleby said the nation's "she'll be right" attitude contributed greatly to the increasing numbers of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We've got to dispel the myths about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "People don't take it seriously.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "They think that if someone talks about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  they won't do it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "But nine out of 10 people tell us they are going to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the public doesn't know what to do about it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "People need to know it's OK to talk about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - it's not contagious." Ms Appleby, who is secretary of Australian National Lifeline, said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention programs should be compulsory in schools like they were in the United States.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Seventy per cent of people who complete \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have tried it once or more before," said Ms Appleby, who has also written a book about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  She said rural areas had a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate up to six times greater than the cities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Women tried \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  more than men, she said, but men actually succeeded in killing themselves more than women.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  While unemployment and broken families were two of the main factors, she said, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  crossed all social boundaries.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Sydney City Mission has organised the first Australian youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention conference, titled Hearing the Cry, on December 12-13.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Quebec has long suffered from one of the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in the industrial world, with more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per capita than any other Canadian province.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates have dropped dramatically over the last few years, as prevention efforts start to pay off, says a Quebec Institute of Public Health report. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Many countries around the world will examine Quebec's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  research today during the sixth annual World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day conference at the United Nations in New York.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We need to use the very considerable knowledge about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that we now have to develop co-ordinated and comprehensive \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention initiatives," Brian Mishara, director of the Universit\'e9 du Qu\'e9bec \'e0 Montr\'e9al's Centre for Research and Intervention on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Euthanasia, said in a statement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We have enough understanding of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention to stop a significant proportion of these tragic deaths," said Mishara, who is also the president of the International Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mishara will present the general theme of this year's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, Think Globally, Plan Nationally, Act Locally, and will announce the latest international figures on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to the UN's World Health Organization today.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 More than one million people around the world will take their own lives this year. That's more than the number of people who will be killed in any war, terrorist attack or homicide.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Quebec, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates among teenage males dropped nearly 75 per cent between 1999 and 2006. For young men, 20 to 34, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates fell by almost 50 per cent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The decrease is a result of several factors, said Johanne Renaud, medical director of the youth section of the Douglas Institute's depressive disorders program.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There has been more detection of cases of mental illness and better organization of treatment," Renaud said.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention programs in high schools, Quebec's 24-hour province-wide \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  help line and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  training workshops for family doctors, medical clinics and CLSCs have also contributed to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention in the province.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Montreal also has two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  research centres, one at UQ\'c0M and the other at the Douglas Institute.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "What continues to be the biggest challenge in treating the mentally ill is the stigma and taboo that stops people from even talking about it," Renaud said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Despite \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention efforts and marked improvements, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  remains the first cause of death among young men. And the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among young Montreal women has actually increased slightly since the late 1990s.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Even if things are getting better, Quebec still has one of the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in the world," Michel Presseault, co-ordinator of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Action Montreal, said yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We still get about 20,000 calls a year," Presseault said. "So even if the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is down, there are still many people in Quebec with severe depression who need help."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 THE Liberals plan to invest a further $3 million to reduce \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Tasmania.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Launching the Liberals' \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategy yesterday, Opposition health spokesman Jeremy Rockcliff said coroners believed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Tasmania was under-reported by 30 per cent. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ``Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the leading cause of death for Tasmanians aged between 15 and 45 and we have the second highest rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Australia,'' he said.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ``Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a complex issue and a Liberal government wants to give extra funding to help local communities.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Liberals want to establish early intervention referrals, especially after a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt or self-harming.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They plan to deliver \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention awareness training to recognise and respond to the signs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The party wants researchers to access information needed to allow in-depth analysis of Tasmanian \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And it plans to analyse \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ``hotspots'' to reduce risks if places are known for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Rockcliff said every life lost to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  came at a huge personal cost to families, friends and communities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ``That is why a majority Liberal government will make this important investment in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention,'' he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Beyondblue founder Jeff Kennett, who spoke at the Liberals' \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  strategy launch, later dropped into the Dunalley Neighbourhood House for a barbecue.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Kennett is on an Australia-wide tour with beyondblue promoting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategies and mental health awareness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ``The last time I was here it was only eight weeks after the [Dunalley] fire,'' he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said the work done by the organisation after the fires had prevented long-term psychological damage to children affected by the blaze.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day was observed on Tuesday to promote actions to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  across the globe.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nearly 3,000 people on average commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  daily and an estimated one million people die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a major preventable cause of premature death, which is influenced by psycho-social, cultural and environmental risk factors that can be prevented through worldwide responses that address risk factors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to a research, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates are 50%-60% higher than the official rates and this social problem is also found in Pakistan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Economic factors leading to depression are one of the reasons for such a high \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in the country. The day promotes issues such as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention. Various events and activities were held on the occasion to raise awareness that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a major preventable cause of premature death.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, which first started in 2003, is co-sponsored by organisations such as the International Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention (IASP) and the World Health Organisation (WHO).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The day gives organisations, government agencies and individuals a chance to promote awareness about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , mental illnesses associated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as well as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention measures.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Monday (Sept. 10) marks the 10th anniversary of World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, a day when people are encouraged to discuss solutions to what is becoming an almost epidemic mental health issue among our young people. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to Children's Mental Health Ontario (CMHO), \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the second leading cause of death among 10-24 year olds in Canada.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Untreated mental illness - depression, in particular - is the leading risk factor for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For every \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  completion, there are thousands more young people having thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , according to the CMHO.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One recent study found one in 10 students in Grades 7-12 reported they had seriously considered \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and about three per cent reported attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among Aboriginal youth is estimated to occur at rates five times higher than non-Aboriginal youth.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To mark World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, the CMHO is joining with the Canadian Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention to encourage communities across the province to get involved by showing their support for people affected by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While support can be expressed many ways, the gift of non-judgmental support is of utmost importance, according to support organizations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Shame is one of the most challenging and prominent feelings around \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The stigma associated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  often prevents those suffering from getting help.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We need to be open and we need to be educated," said Gordon Floyd, president and CEO of CMHO. "Let's remove the stigma associated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and start talking about it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One-in-five children and youth has a mental health issue severe enough to seriously affect their daily functioning at home, school or within the community.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Early intervention remains critical to young people having the best possible chance at succeeding in all aspects of their life.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A serious rift has appeared among \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  experts over policies targeting male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The debate erupted yesterday as the Males and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Symposium 2005 organised by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Information New Zealand (Spinz) opened in Christchurch. Spinz is a non-government, New Zealand-wide information service, in partnership with the Mental Health Foundation. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  researchers based at the Christchurch School of Medicine and Health Sciences have challenged claims by Spinz director Merryn Statham, calling them "misleading".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a statement supported by six other academics, Associate Professor Annette Beautrais said yesterday Statham had pointed to the disproportionate rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in males and proposed male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was a major area to be addressed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, a clear decline in the male to female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ratio had occurred in recent years, she said. In 1994, four males took their own lives for every one female. By 2002 the ratio had declined to 3.2 males for every one female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Under these circumstances the extent to which further policies to reduce gender differences are needed is debatable."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Research showed the higher rate of male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  could be attributed to males using more lethal methods for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Beautrais said it was also misleading to claim that New Zealand had not made efforts to address access to lethal methods of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  such as firearms.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A recent study from the Christchurch researchers found after the introduction of the Arms Amendment Act in 1992 the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by firearms fell by almost half.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Beautrais said the major method of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in New Zealand was hanging, which accounted for almost half of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Beautrais said the data supported the need for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention efforts in New Zealand to focus on the causes of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rather than means.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Between 450 and 500 people each year die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in New Zealand -- more than the average road toll and more than by drowning or homicide.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day is observed on September 10 each year including Pakistan to promote worldwide action to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  across the globe. Nearly 3000 people on average commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  daily, according to WHO. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 About one million people die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a major preventable cause of premature death which is influenced by psycho-social, cultural and environmental risk factors that can be prevented through worldwide responses that address these main risk factors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to a research \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates are 60 percent higher than the official rate and this social problem is also found in Pakistan. Economic factors leading to depression were also one of the reasons for such a high \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in the country and poverty was a risk factor.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This day promotes issues such as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention. Various events and activities are held during this occasion to raise awareness that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a major preventable cause of premature death.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, which first started in 2003, is co-sponsored by organizations such as the International Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention (IASP) and World Health Organization (WHO) that play a key role in promoting this event.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day gives organizations, government agencies and individuals a chance to promote awareness about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , mental illnesses associated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , as well as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 MIND Cymru set about trying to analyse the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  figures in Denbighshire and Conwy and asked North Wales Police for help.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police figures showed that between January 2005 and December 2006, the police had 219 "attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " calls from Conwy and 16 calls where a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had taken place and from Denbighshire 172 attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  calls and 13 after a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had taken place.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Half the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  calls in Denbighshire came from Rhyl and 84% of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  calls in both counties were male. Most recorded \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were in the 40-50 age range.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is one of the most underestimated community health problems in the world. The World Health Organisation say more people die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year than are killed in all the armed conflicts and homicides combined.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There were 270 reported \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Wales in 2004, population 2,952,000 - roughly twice as many as died in road traffic accidents.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The National Office for Statistics estimates that 3.9% of the population have thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in any one year, while the Samaritans say 5% - between 100,000-150,000 people in Wales.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The recent National Confidential Inquiry into \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the UK found that those people who die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are four times more likely to have seen a police officer in three months before death than a mental health professional.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A serious rift has appeared among \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  experts over policies targeting male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The debate erupted yesterday as the Males and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Symposium 2005 organised by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Information New Zealand (Spinz) opened in Christchurch.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Spinz is a non-government information service, in partnership with the Mental Health Foundation. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  researchers based at the Christchurch School of Medicine and Health Sciences have challenged claims by Spinz director Merryn Statham, calling them "misleading".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a statement supported by six other academics, Associate Professor Annette Beautrais said yesterday Statham had pointed to the disproportionate rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in males and proposed male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was a major area to be addressed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, a clear decline in the male to female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ratio had occurred in recent years, she said. In 1994, four males took their own lives for every one female. By 2002, the ratio had declined to 3.2 males for every one female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Under these circumstances the extent to which further policies to reduce gender differences are needed is debatable."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Research showed the higher rate of male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  could be attributed to males using more lethal methods for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts. Beautrais said it was also misleading to claim that New Zealand had not made efforts to address access to lethal methods of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  such as firearms.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A recent study by the Christchurch researchers found after the introduction of the Arms Amendment Act in 1992 the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by firearms fell by almost half.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Beautrais said the major method of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in New Zealand was hanging, which accounted for almost half of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Beautrais said the data supported the need for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention efforts in New Zealand to focus on the causes of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rather than means.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Between 450 and 500 people each year die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in New Zealand -- more than the average road toll and more than by drowning or homicide.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Statham said last night that Spinz was disappointed that the Christchurch research group did not take up the opportunity to present or participate in the symposium.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The focus is on men in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  because more men than women die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . By hosting a research symposium Spinz provides an opportunity for robust debate about trends, causes and interventions," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Wendy Lester, whose son, Jeremy, took his own life last year when he was 23, said the issue was complicated but males had more trouble asking for help than females and could benefit from specific policies.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It comes down to the culture here.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Men don't want to express their feelings and the stigma of mental illness is strong," she said.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  numbers have dropped significantly in South Canterbury.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Only two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were dealt with by the coroner in the past year, the lowest in the seven years the latest statistics cover. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Previously, the lowest number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the region was four in 2008/09.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The statistics released yesterday by Chief Coroner Judge Neil MacLean showed South Canterbury was on par with the rest of the country.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 New Zealand has also had the lowest number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  recorded since July 2007. During that period South Canterbury has had 56 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The figures peaked with 17 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  during the 2011/12 year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Last year, South Canterbury had the equal lowest number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  regionally with Tairawhiti.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The chief coroner said nationally youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  numbers - those under 24 years - were significantly down from last year, with 110 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reported, compared with 144. "We've also seen the lowest number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the 15 to 19-year-old cohort in the last seven years with 46, which is down 17 on last year and 34 the year before.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The drop in teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is good news. These are the some of the toughest and most tragic cases coroners deal with."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 From a national perspective, his report also mentioned:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The rate of males committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was higher than females at a ratio of 2.5:1, down from 3:1.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The lowest number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was in the 35 to 39-year-old age group with 35 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 About one in every five people who commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is Maori.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The 10th World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day was commemorated yesterday, Monday September 10, 2012. A report by the World Health Organisation, WHO, released prior to the commemoration reveals that one person dies from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every 40 seconds while one million die every year in the world. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to a WHO official, Dr. Shekhar Saxena, who presented the report, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate has increased by 60 per cent in some countries in the last 10 years. The report notes that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the thirteenth leading cause of death the world over. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths are most common amongst teens and adults below the age of 35. Males are three to four times more likely to kill themselves than females the world over.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every year worldwide. According to the report, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  affects everybody, irrespective of class. Levels of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are higher among retired people, divorcees, the unemployed, childless, city dwellers and people living alone.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Paradoxically, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is far greater in some high-standard-of-living countries than in poor countries. Scandinavian countries record the highest rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Europe. In Italy, the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases recorded among the unemployed increased by 30 per cent in 2010. In France, 11,000 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases are recorded every year with one third coming from persons aged above 65 years. In Africa, WHO officials faced challenges assembling statistics because \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a considered a taboo and ill-omen in most cultures. Nevertheless, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases are recorded in all communities. In Cameroon, it is not uncommon today to find reports of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases in the press every week.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day promotes worldwide commitment and action to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The International Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention, WHO and other partners advocate the prevention of suicidal behaviour.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A NEW resource is being developed to help small communities in Western NSW and other parts of the state try to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but also cope in its aftermath.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day 2013 yesterday, Barwon MP and NSW Mental Health Minister Kevin Humphries announced the Small Towns Toolkit would be launched later this year. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Details of the resource are still under wraps.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The NSW Mental Health Commission is working on the toolkit and other resources after the state government conducted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention forums in communities across the state.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Humphries said the meetings had been "crucial" in shaping its \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention response.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "As a direct result of these forums the NSW Mental Health Commission is developing a range of resources to better support communities affected by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  such as the Small Towns Toolkit, to help small communities to both prevent acts of self-harm and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , as well as deal with the impacts when they occur," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Humphries also used World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day to encourage conversations about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said openly talking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had multiple benefits, including raising awareness of warning signs and reducing stigma that prevented people from seeking help.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 About 65,000 Australians attempt to take their lives each year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Every death by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is one death too many, and in NSW 550 lives are lost to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year," the minister said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The warning signs that someone could be at risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  often go undetected but when people are aware of them there is a far greater chance that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be prevented."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Humphries said taking the time to find out more about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and recognise the warning signs could one day "help save someone's life".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The theme for World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day 2013 was Stigma: A Major Barrier to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Humphries said stigma was "one of the biggest barriers to recovery".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 People at risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and their loved ones were impacted by it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It is up to all of us to help reduce stigma by talking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and increasing awareness to better ensure that people at risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , as well as their families, friends and carers, are connected with the treatment and support they need," Mr Humphries said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Most of us will experience challenging times at some point in our lives, yet people are often reluctant to acknowledge there is a problem, or have trouble knowing how to talk about it, which only serves to worsen the stigma and stop people from seeking help early on."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 THE theme for World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day 2009 is \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 ``Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention in different cultures''.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This recognises that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a major preventable cause of premature death that impacts on all cultures, worldwide. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Mental Health Association of Central Australia will be holding an event for World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day on Thursday at the memorial site on the lawns between the Senior Citizen's Centre and the Totem Theatre from 3.30pm to 5pm.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The event is part of an international initiative to raise public awareness of the severity of the problem of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but also to learn about effective \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention approaches in Central Australia and what support is out there for families and communities at a local level.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day is one day to have less silence and more understanding about the issue of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There are more deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Australia each year than by car accidents -- and for every \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  there are at least 20 people who try to end their lives.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Then there are all those people who are bereaved through \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , often contributing to a complex mix of emotions, unanswered questions and sometimes shame associated with the stigma of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and mental illness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The stigma, discrimination and misunderstanding surrounding \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  make it difficult for those struggling with suicidal thoughts to talk about their pain and reach out for support.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day is a chance to highlight that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can affect all of us.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It does not discriminate. It crosses class, gender, age and cultural boundaries.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For this reason, we all have a role to play in creating communities that are socially inclusive and to learn how we can be more supportive and less afraid of the issue.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 By speaking up rather than avoiding the issue of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and through the development of culturally appropriate resources to educate and increase awareness among people from different backgrounds we can help to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As there are educational campaigns to warn of the risks of drink driving and speeding as preventable causes of premature death, so too are there educational workshops to teach people to identify and intervene to keep someone safe from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be stopped.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is important to acknowledge the families in remote and regional communities, night patrol workers, clinic staff, women's centres, schools, councils, medical teams, youth workers, drug and alcohol, telephone counsellors and family violence workers who are providing support to people involved in self-harming behaviour on a regular basis.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is also important to acknowledge the community development, health promotion, prevention and early intervention work that build capacity and strength in communities and families.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 People need to be well-equipped to deal with the challenges life presents.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For more information contact the Life Promotion Program of the Mental Health Association of Central Australia on 8950 4600.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A staggering 22 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  daily in South Africa last year but this jumped to 31 over the festive season.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the South African Depression and Anxiety Group (SADAG), these figures continue to increase every year. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SADAG's project manager Janine Samos said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts increase massively between November and January. An estimated 9 128 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in South Africa in the past 12 months. She said for every one completed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  there were 10 attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said teenage \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was becoming more common in South Africa every year and an alarming one in 12 adolescents have attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at least once. Recent statistics showed that 9% of all teenage deaths are due to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to Professor Lourens Schlebusch of the University of KwaZulu-Natal Medical School teenagers who committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were in the 10-19 age group. "Over the last two years we have noticed that the age of teenagers who are committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is dropping, they are getting younger and younger. You now hear of 10-year-olds committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Schlebusch said research showed that although more females attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , more males succeed. He said this was due to the fact that males use more lethal ways to kill themselves. "For every one female that dies from killing herself, four males die. Males often use a violent method to kill themselves, they use guns or gas or they hang themselves whereas females will normally overdose on pills, drink poisonous household substances or slit their wrists," he explained.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Prof. Lee Kwang-ja, a 65-year-old \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention specialist, will retire next month after 37 years of teaching. 'Your life is not your own,' she emphasized on July 28.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She was appointed as a professor in 1976 and was a member of Korea's first \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention hotline.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Beginning as a volunteer hotline operator, she has counseled over 3,000 people and is now Head of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Center. She helped in the establishment of the Korean Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention, implemented an education program on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, gave lectures on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and conducted numerous researches on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She has counseled an average of 43.6 people a day for at least 33 minutes in the span of 40 years, saying she could not let even one life fall victim to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 'Our society thinks too lightly of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . We must all self-reflect about how \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  should not be used as a performance,' she said on the topic of Sung Jae-gi, who recently jumped off a bridge for political purposes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 'We must stay vigilant for copycat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ,' she said. 'Once a person commits \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , it leaves a psychological effect on six of his friends, instilling thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . If the person is popular and famous, this may lead to a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cluster among those influenced by the person's death.'
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She opens a workshop for college students every semester, acting as a mentor for the students. 'College students nowadays have a very strong sense of pride, but their self-esteem is very low. Rising professors and teachers must not become thesis-writing machines, but instead help maximize each student's potential.'

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 The number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Alberta has soared, making the province's rate the second highest in Canada, a new study says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A report from the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Information Centre in Alberta released on Thursday said that with more than 400 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  last year, Alberta is just behind Quebec.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While the territories have higher \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates, Quebec has the highest rate in the country, at more than 18.0 per 100,000 people. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The figures show Alberta's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is 16.3 per 100,000 people. The national average is 14.0 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 people, or 3,698 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , says Statistics Canada.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The fact the numbers are where they are shows we need to work to bring that down," said Dr. Pierre Beausejour, chief of staff for the Alberta Mental Health Board.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Keith Turton, community education co-ordinator at the Alberta North Central Region of the Canadian Mental Health Association, said there are two groups most likely to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Canada: Teenagers aged 14 to 24, with the majority being aboriginal males, who account for many of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Alberta, and people over 60.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr. Turton said the high aboriginal population in Alberta might account for the rising number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . "Aboriginal people have a history of addiction, substance abuse problems," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have to do with social factors. It happens when people feel unable to cope, teenagers don't know where they belong or elderly people feel like they're a burden. Every \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has reasons that may not make sense to the general public," Mr. Turton said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr. Stephen Newman, a family doctor and an epidemiologist in the department of psychiatry and a professor at the University of Alberta, said the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is higher in Canada than in the U.S.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "While \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has been declining in the United States and in other Western countries, the Canadian \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate has been more or less constant for the last 20 years," said Dr. Newman, who recently completed a study on attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in Alberta used to be higher than other provinces because of the stress of boom-and-bust economic cycle the province experiences. He also attributed the high \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate to low income and the large population of native people. "This explains why the territories, especially Nunavut, also have a high rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr. Newman said that after accidents, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the second most common cause of death in young people, and more Canadians die from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than from motor vehicle accidents.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Alberta's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate was always higher than the national average, but until last year, New Brunswick had the second-highest rate. According to the studies of Dr. Newman, 250 per 100,000 people in Edmonton have attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The rate of attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Edmonton is one of the highest in Western countries," he said. There were 2,118 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts among 1,667 people in 1997. In that same year, there were 100 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Health Ministry says new figures show a decline in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Provisional 1999 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  statistics for all ages show 514 people died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in that year, compared with 577 in 1998 and 561 in 1997. The 1999 total is the lowest since 1994 (512), ministry spokeswoman Maria Cotter said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's encouraging to know these rates can come down but the figures are still too high," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Every \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a personal tragedy and devastates families, friends, colleagues and communities. While the decrease in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is encouraging, we must all try to create an environment where people are supported enough to value their own lives."
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths have reduced among Maori and non-Maori.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The overall rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among Maori was the same as for non-Maori in 1999.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates are still significantly higher among Maori than non-Maori.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ms Cotter said preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was a priority under the New Zealand Health Strategy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is not only an issue for the health system, it's an issue for New Zealand society," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Although there is no one cause and no single way to address the issue of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Government and the community need to continue working together to reduce and prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "These latest figures still make New Zealand's youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate the highest among selected OECD countries, although international comparisons are difficult as countries have different reporting methods."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ms Cotter said the New Zealand Youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Strategy worked to reduce youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , with a specific focus on preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among Maori youth.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This strategy, launched in 1998, is now led by the Youth Affairs Ministry.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The 1999 statistics are provisional as there is a small number of outstanding deaths awaiting a coroner's finding.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  statistics for 2000 are expected to be available later this year. -- NZPA

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A DATE has been set for the next safeTALK training session, which could potentially prepare you to save a life. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SafeTALK is a half-day presentation to increase \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  awareness; the program alerts community members to signs that a person may be considering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It acknowledges that while most people at risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  signal their distress and invite help, these intervention opportunities are often overlooked.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Participants learn to recognise when someone may have thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and to respond in ways that link them with further \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  intervention help.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  alert helpers contribute to a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  safe community.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 safeTalk participants will be better prepared to recognise that invitations to help are often overlooked, move beyond common tendencies to miss, dismiss and avoid \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , notice and respond to situations in which thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  may be present, apply basic TALK steps (Tell, Ask, Listen and KeepSafe) and connect the person with thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  first aid help and further community resources.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  alert community members are better prepared to be a vital link in connecting persons at risk with further help.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The next training date is Tuesday September 10 from 3pm 6.30pm at the Cottage Mossman Community Centre.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The cost is free thanks to the Mossman Rotary Club, but gold coin donations are invited for afternoon tea.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 DATELINE: \b0 \i0 \ul0 Kathmandu 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kathmandu, June 10 -- In the last three years, there have been 718 registered \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases inside the valley, according to a survey by Nepal Social Development Association (NSDA). However, further data and information regarding \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  inside the valley are difficult to verify as police records are not accurate enough, the survey also said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A workshop on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Suicidal Attempts on June 9 discussed the preliminary report of the study which shows statistical data of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases from different regions of Nepal from August 2008 to February 2009. "Our survey found that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases in the Valley along with the mode of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the reasons behind the act and other attributes are not recorded properly," said Ambika Regmi, president of NSDA. The report says that most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases in Nepal are in urban regions, while in Kathmandu, majority of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims are drug users. Ethnic groups top the list of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims with 56.13 per cent of all reported \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The report also says that males are more prone to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , while the majority commits \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by hanging. There are reports of 3 boys less than 10 years of age committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , which the NSDA believes is not correct and could be a result of confusion over unnatural death. Regmi says, "We've planned to give police stations a format of how data should be collected. We believe we will be able to collect more accurate data by our next survey which will certainly help to resolve the problem."Published by HT Syndication with permission from EKantipur.com.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  CHILD \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has risen sharply in Queensland, with 18 children under 16 taking their life in 1996.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The average for the preceding five years was six deaths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, the State Government, which received a report on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  last week, has been told that 1996 might have been "an isolated bad year". 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Queensland: A Comprehensive Study, was prepared by the Australian Institute for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Research and Prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Institute founding director Pierre Baume said the large amount of publicity associated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in recent times and pro-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites on the Internet might be factors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Some schools which had attempted to run \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention programs may also have inadvertently contributed to a rise by emphasising \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention had become a "big industry" and criticised the promoters of some prevention programs which were "doing more harm than good". He praised a State Government initiative which would promote a community approach to preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Co-author Chris Cantor said the 1996 figure could be a "random fluke" and might not indicate a trend. But the report urged the State Government to increase monitoring of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in school-aged children.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It studied \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Queensland between 1990 and 1995 and painted the most detailed picture yet of the problem. It is being studied by Health Minister Mike Horan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Key findings included:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Queensland \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates were more than 20 percent above the national average.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Since 1960, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate for 15 to 24-year-old Australian males had risen from 6.8 per 100,000 to 25.3 per 100,000 in 1995, while the Queensland \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate was 29.5 per 100,000 in 1995.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Aboriginal males was nearly twice the Queensland average.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates were highest in the Cape York region and the central west of the state, with communities such as Yarrabah and Palm Island having concerning rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Males were more likely to choose hanging, carbon monoxide poisoning and firearms to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  while a large proportion of females chose drug overdoses.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Broken relationships were blamed for 15 percent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Horan said the State Government this year would increase funding to the $1 million youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategy announced last year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said the report would form a valuable resource to the 19 project officers who were establishing regional community networks to combat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . He said he was disturbed by the number of school-aged \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  uncovered by the report. "You wonder whether kids grow up in a relaxed way these days . . . whether kids have enough quality kids time."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mar. 4--These are the statistics nobody wants to talk about:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 --One \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  death every 17 minutes in the United States.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 --88 deaths per day in the United States. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 --750,000 attempts per year in the United States.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 --One out of 64 people will attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at some point during their lives.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 --Five million living Americans have attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at least once in their life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 --Someone attempts \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every 40 seconds in the United States, on average.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 --Each \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  intimately affects six other people, on average.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 --Women attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  twice as often as men.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 --A woman succeeds in taking her life every 90 minutes, but attempts \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  once every 78 seconds across the nation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 --In 2005, more than six Texans died from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every day.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These are some of the many troubling statistics concerning \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that often get ignored or swept under the rug of a politically correct society that doesn't want \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to be an issue.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When people start to look at how prevalent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is in our culture, it begs the question: Why don't we hear about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  until we are remembering someone who has recently killed
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 themselves?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a leading cause of death that carries a huge social cost, yet because of complex issues such as the stigma associated with mental illness and the lack of adequate research and surveillance dedicated to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , it is seldom recognized as a significant health problem," said the Texas \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention council on its Web site.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although Texas ranks near the bottom for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in the country -- 38 of 50 -- it remains a major cause of death, especially for adolescents and seniors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Texas alone, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the 10th leading cause of death overall and the third leading cause of death among youth ages 15 to 24.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Regardless of age, males in Texas are more likely to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than women -- in 2003, 78 percent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were males.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One of the more surprising statistics is \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in Texas were the highest for people 70 and older, nearly 17.5 for every 10,000 people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 2005, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates rose in Texas to 2,418, up from 2,355 in 2003. Demographically, Caucasians made up 74 percent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; African-Americans made up six percent and Hispanics made up 18 percent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Most people choose to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with a firearm, 57 percent; hanging, 21 percent; 16 percent poisoning; 6 percent by other means. However, males are much more likely to use a firearm, 62 to 41, than females. Females were more likely to poison themselves, 35 to 11 percent, according to statistics compiled by John Hellsten, Texas Department of State Health Services.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Statistics for this article were compiled from Texas \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention, American Foundation for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention, Texas \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Symposium and the Texas Department of State Health Services.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day is Sept. 10, a reminder that we can, and must, reduce \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  impact and help more people see the hope and possibility in their lives. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This year's date has an added poignancy, as people mourn the loss of Robin Williams. His passing has been a powerful illustration of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  tragedy and complexity, and the profound sadness it leaves in its wake.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sadly, in Alberta this year, we will lose about 500 people to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . About 75 per cent will be men, with most between the ages of 30 and 60.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For each person who dies by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , many others are affected. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  painful consequences mean that support and care for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  survivors are a critical part of our community response.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention in Alberta is spearheaded by Alberta Health Services, the Canadian Mental Health Association, the Support Network, the Distress Centre, the Centre for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention, the United Way, and others. We have an outstanding treatment system that includes health professionals, psychologists, psychiatrists, counsellors and support programs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The single biggest protective factor against \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is connection with people who care. Family, community members, friends and colleagues have a role in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I strongly believe we must bring the conversation more into the open and stop talking
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in hushed terms.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We must reduce the stigma and see \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as an unfortunate outcome of feeling hopeless.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We must also understand that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is often linked to diseases such as depression, schizophrenia or addiction, which can severely distort a person's thoughts and feelings.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Many of the organizations above have information on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention on their websites.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Alberta \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Network has launched a new prevention campaign at keephimhere.ca.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jan. 25--The number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Pueblo County in 2008 was the lowest it's been in four years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the Pueblo County Coroner's accountability report, 21 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  here during the past year. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That's significantly lower than the 34 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  recorded in 2007. In 2006 there were 23 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and 31 the year before, according to the report.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While 2008 saw spikes in homicides, accidental deaths and the number of death investigations by the coroner's office, the decline in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was a pleasant surprise to Coroner James Kramer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Historically, we've had more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per capita than the rest of the state. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  being down is good news," Kramer said this week.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pueblo County's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate ranks among the worst in the state in terms of overall deaths. Colorado as a whole ranks among the worst nationwide, according to Jarrod Hindman, director for the state health department's office of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to data from 2000-2007 (statewide totals for 2008 were not available), Pueblo County has the eighth-highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate. During that time frame, there have been 231 reported \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  here, which includes victims of all ages and gender.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The statistics are a little misleading because they're based on population," Hindman said. "In total number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Pueblo ranks eighth in the state. The interesting thing was Mesa (County) was first in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate and Pueblo (County) was second, based on the number of deaths per 100,000 population."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jan. 25--The number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Pueblo County in 2008 was the lowest it's been in four years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the Pueblo County Coroner's accountability report, 21 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  here during the past year. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That's significantly lower than the 34 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  recorded in 2007. In 2006 there were 23 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and 31 the year before, according to the report.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While 2008 saw spikes in homicides, accidental deaths and the number of death investigations by the coroner's office, the decline in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was a pleasant surprise to Coroner James Kramer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Historically, we've had more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per capita than the rest of the state. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  being down is good news," Kramer said this week.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pueblo County's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate ranks among the worst in the state in terms of overall deaths. Colorado as a whole ranks among the worst nationwide, according to Jarrod Hindman, director for the state health department's office of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to data from 2000-2007 (statewide totals for 2008 were not available), Pueblo County has the eighth-highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate. During that time frame, there have been 231 reported \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  here, which includes victims of all ages and gender.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The statistics are a little misleading because they're based on population," Hindman said. "In total number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Pueblo ranks eighth in the state. The interesting thing was Mesa (County) was first in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate and Pueblo (County) was second, based on the number of deaths per 100,000 population."

\par \pard

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is not a subject easily broached.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, the awkwardness and/or fear of discussing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  pales in comparison to the damage caused if the complex issue is not brought to the forefront. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For example, did you know:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 30 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths occur each year on average in Halton
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Halton there are more than 420 hospitalizations each year from attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Halton Regional Police receives, on average, one call per day related to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Those are frightening statistics to be sure, however by bringing the issue of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  into the light, steps can be taken to help reduce those numbers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Last Friday was World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day and Halton Region, along with the Halton \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Coalition (HSPC), wants to raise awareness about the Coalition's updated website that offers easy-to-access information and support for anyone either considering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or wanting to help a suicidal person.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The website is www.suicidepreventionhalton.ca.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Taking the lead from the Coalition, we can build a greater understanding in Halton about the warning signs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the support available to help prevent it", said Regional Chair Gary Carr. "It's a complex issue and I encourage residents to visit the updated HSPC website or call the Region for more information."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Halton \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Coalition is a coalition of the Halton Region Health Department, local health and social services organizations, and individuals interested in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Halton Hills, a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention group-H.E.A.L.- is also available to help. The group was formed three years ago to develop \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, intervention and advocacy strategies by increasing awareness and fostering links between those who need support and those who can offer help.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 By working together and openly discussing the issue of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , it is hoped that, in time, the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Halton Region will significantly decline.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To ignore the issue certainly is not the answer.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fewer people are dying by their own hand but more are ending up in hospital after attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , new figures show.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Trends, released by the Health Ministry yesterday, details patterns in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempts over the 20 years from 1983 to 2003. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While self-inflicted deaths rose from 465 in 2002 to 526 in 2003, three-yearly averages show \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  death rates have dropped 15 per cent since the mid to late 1990s.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, the number of people being admitted to hospital for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts has increased nearly 24 per cent since the mid-1980s. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Canterbury \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Project principal investigator Annette Beautrais said the figures indicated better treatment for suicidal people. While available data did not include medical information, the most likely explanation was that more people were being admitted for a full psychiatric assessment and management plan following \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Trends report, 25 to 34-year- olds had the highest rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , with men three times more likely to kill themselves than women. However, women were more likely than men to be hospitalised for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Maori, especially men under 35 years, and those living in low socioeconomic areas had the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Associate Health Minister Jim Anderton said there was no room for complacency, despite declining \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates. "When you see the increase in attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  . . . you know there is still much to be done."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A 10-year \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategy, announced in June, aims to cut \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in all age groups. A five-year action plan to implement stage one of the strategy is to be released next year. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  research network and national depression initiative is also to be established.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sept. 11--\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts have increased statewide in the past six years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lewis County is no exception.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Coroner Warren McLeod said the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has steadily increased over the past four years. In 2011, 11 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the county. The following year, there were 14 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Last year, there were 16. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 So far this year, McLeod anticipates the number to be even higher, as there are still three full months left in the year and there have already been 16 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We want to reduce this number because it's totally preventable," McLeod said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The coroner said the 911 dispatch center receives an average of about three calls a week about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts or people calling in concerned about other individuals committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This week is National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Week, and according to the the Department of Health, on average, three people every day take their own lives in Washington.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 From 2006 to 2012, the statewide \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate has increased slightly, according to the Department of Health. While \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is Washington's eighth leading cause of death, second for those between the ages of 15 and 24, thousands of people are hospitalized every year for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 McLeod said his office has looked at the local statistics about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to see if there was a trend, such as geographic location or age. It appears to be random.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There is no one common theme," McLeod said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Most of those who committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Lewis County were men, and the No. 1 means of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was firearms, McLeod said. While the large majority of the county's population is concentrated in the Chehalis and Centralia area, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are spread throughout the county.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The age range has been between 13 and 96, he said. For the older individuals, the reasons behind \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  appeared to be more medical issues such as long-term, debilitating diseases. For the younger people, the issues appeared to be social.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's very rarely the economy," McLeod said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Teenage \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can sometimes snowball, McLeod said. After the death of a 13-year-old Mossyrock boy last year, mental health professionals went into the boy's middle school and met with students to ensure there were no more attempts or \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Due to the increasing number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , McLeod said, he has spoken with people from Cascade Mental Health and Lewis County Public Health and there has been talk of forming a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  coalition in the county.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Coalitions, however, require funding, so McLeod said they are looking at possible grants. They have also talked about doing public forums in both ends of the county to address the issue.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I am not sure how much we can do," he said.

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A new study suggests that suicidal thoughts are "contagious," especially among young adolescents.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Researchers had long observed, a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "copycat" effect, which predicts an increase in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  after a single high-profile \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Some studies have suggested up to 13 percent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are copycat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that can be explained by "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  clustering."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But a study published Tuesday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal suggests a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  doesn't have to be highly publicized in order to cause an impact in others.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The study found students 12-13 years old who had a classmate that committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were nearly five times as likely to have thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than someone who had never had a classmate kill themselves. Nearly a quarter of 16-17-year-olds studied had a classmate that committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 : 15.1 percent of those students said they had thought of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , compared to 7.4 percent of students who didn't have a classmate who had killed themselves. The study found similar effects for people who had actually attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The effects seem to last for at least two years following a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The idea that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is contagious has always been controversial for various reasons; however, this important study should put many, if not all, doubts to rest," India Bohanna, a researcher studying \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at Australia's James Cook University wrote in an analysis of the paper. "It provides convincing evidence that, among young people, exposure to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a risk factor for future suicidal behavior."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Before performing the research, study lead author Sonja Swanson of Harvard School of Public Health, expected to find an increase in suicidal thoughts among students who personally knew someone who had committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Many schools offer "postvention" therapy for students who are close to a person who has killed themselves in an effort to prevent a second \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . But the data suggests a teen doesn't have to be particularly close to someone who has killed themselves to be affected.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  death of a schoolmate was a stronger predictor of suicidality outcomes than \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by someone personally known, perhaps because the death of a peer resonates with youth more than the death of a close adult," according to the study. "Thus, it may be best for postvention strategies to include all students rather than target close friends."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Contradicting assumptions that teenage \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  may prompt copycat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by friends, a Pittsburgh psychiatrist says a teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  friends and acquaintances are not likely to imitate him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 David Brent of Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic says parental concern had arisen since the early 1980s about "adolescent cluster \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as waves of teenagers who live in the same town have committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  within days or months of each other.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Brent says a study he led of teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in southwestern Pennsylvania found that friends and acquaintances of teens who killed themselves did not become more likely to attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There are serious effects of exposure to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the friends of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims, says Brent, director of the institute's Services for Teens at Risk program.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Almost a third of them become depressed, but they don't imitate the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . That probably occurs in teens more distantly connected to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victim.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 His study found that teenagers with a peer who killed himself were three times more likely than other teens to suffer a prolonged major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder that made them jittery, and increased drug and alcohol abuse.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They were also more prone to thinking about -- and even planning -- their own \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But, based on anecdotal responses from the study, the youngsters closest to the dead teenager did not carry out their own suicidal plans, because they were exposed not only to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but to the painful after-effects on the victim's family and friends, says Brent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Teens who don't know a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  may be more likely to imitate the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  precisely because they don't see those effects on people close to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victim, he reasons.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When a teenager kills himself, "kids who are known to have pre-existing problems should be screened in school -- regardless of their closeness to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victim -- because they are the most vulnerable, says Brent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "In kids who have been exposed to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , one should take their symptoms of depression seriously and not just pass it off as normal bereavement, because many of them do have prolonged difficulties.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Take time to listen to individual stories, writes Kate Munro. TODAY is World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day. It is held on September 10 each year and provides an opportunity to discuss \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention openly and respectfully.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What it really does is allow our community to be brave and to actually say the word \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Journalist and author Kate Legge was the guest speaker at a Lifeline Newcastle and Hunter event on Thursday to honour World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day. She reminded us that it was not that long ago that the community didn't say the "Big C" (cancer) word. We have certainly come a long way with some health issues, but, sadly, stigma and taboo still exists around the issues of mental health and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . By making \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention everybody's business, we too can change attitudes and connect with those in need in our own community. The value in listening to every individual's story - whether that is someone who is having thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or those bereaved by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - has become clear to me since I began managing the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Service at Lifeline Newcastle and Hunter. While I welcome all opportunities to engage responsibly in a conversation about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, it is when I work with individuals and families that I realise \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is everybody's business and as a community we need to feel safe to talk about this complex issue. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a tough, confronting subject to talk about. It is sobering, serious and saddening. Understanding when, how, why and who should talk about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is important. Being able to go out into our community and provide opportunities for people to explore this complex issue via training programs such Livingworks Applied \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Intervention Skills Training, allows for appropriate discussions to occur. It also allows people to learn a valuable life skill in keeping someone with thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  safe. As a community we need to recognise that a person who is vulnerable to the possibility of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  does not have the emotional resources and support to cope with their challenges. Identifying and assisting those individuals who are vulnerable is an important element of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention. We need to be able to connect with those people with thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and those bereaved by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , by providing support, appropriate resources, care and listening. Kate Munro is the manager of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Service at Lifeline Newcastle and Hunter.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 CROSSFIRE
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Yesterday, Ross Eastgate argued it was time to report \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  publicly in order to save lives. Today, Robyn Wuth argues that to do so could backfire on society's most vulnerable.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 IT would be easy to publicise \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Even easier to sensationalise it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The media could go into the gory details - readers love gory details as much as rubberneckers at a car accident. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The media could come up with a string of arguments that the reporting was responsible, raised community awareness, that it
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 actually helped others by talking about the elephant in the room.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But weigh that argument against the real risk of copycat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and any possible benefit is a terrible gamble.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And there is debate about whether reporting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  would help at all.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There's a good reason the media must be sensitive about reporting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Reliable Australian research shows reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can have an impact on vulnerable people, people who already harbour such thoughts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In some cases, reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has been linked to increased rates of actual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A major 1995 study of coverage in Australian newspapers found rates of male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  increased after reports of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , peaking on the third day after the story appeared.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Higher rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have been reported during periods when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  stories are run in newspapers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Higher rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have sometimes been recorded after celebrity \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  receive front-page coverage.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hollywood heart-throb Owen Wilson's attempt to take his life remains one on the most popular searches on the internet more than a week after the incident.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Should his attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have been reported? He's just a man clearly struggling to cope.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Under the guise of 'celebrity' and the public's 'right to know', we now know the comic reportedly slashed his wrists and took a cocktail of pills, apparently devastated over his break-up with actress Kate Hudson.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The star has begged for privacy to 'heal in private' after media reports claimed he was taken to hospital over a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Do the reports benefit or titillate the public?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A quick internet search reveals hundreds of pages covering the tragic \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Not one page I viewed carried a warning, or was tagged with a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  help-line.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A 1984 US study found a significant increase in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in months in which front-page articles were published on celebrity \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Higher rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by a particular method have been found to follow the appearance of newspaper stories on a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by such methods.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The number of subway \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts in Vienna dropped after the introduction of media guidelines led to less frequent reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in these locations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's not just newspapers. Studies have found rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  increase after television news reports of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A 1982 American study found the national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate increased for a period of 10 days after a news story on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Increases in teenage \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have also been recorded following news stories on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in international studies. Coverage of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of elderly people has also been linked to higher levels of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by older people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Several studies have found the number of attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  increased following the broadcast of a television movie or soap opera depicting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is also evidence the way \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is reported can reduce \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Reporting that positions \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as a tragic waste and an avoidable loss, and focuses on the devastating impact of the act on others has been linked to reduced rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For example, a 1997 Australian study of reporting of Kurt Cobain's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in a range of media found rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among 15 to 24-year-olds fell during the month after Cobain's death because media coverage of Cobain's death was highly critical of his decision to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There are those who would scoff at such statistics and claim it is rubbish, but it is the vulnerable who are most at risk.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is no doubt depression is a major cause of suicidal behaviour. Of those who do kill themselves, many have experienced major depression or bipolar disorder.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Research shows about 20 per cent of Australians are affected by some form of mental disorder at some time in their lives.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the main cause of premature death among people with mental illness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 More than 10 per cent of those affected kill themselves within the first 10 years of diagnosis.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For every person who kills themselves, there are at least another 30 people who attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 More than 2000 Australians die from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every year. The media cannot be careful enough not to add to that figure.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  ALMOST half the people who commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Queensland had been drinking alcohol, a ground-breaking \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  study has found.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Queensland study by Griffith University's Australian Institute for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Research and Prevention found 43 percent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims who had been tested for blood-alcohol content had been drinking before taking their own lives. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Institute founding director Associate Professor Dr Pierre Baume said the study's findings that alcohol was present in almost 50 percent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases were consistent with other studies into \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Prof Baume said binge drinking was a major circumstance in many \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, about 700 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims during the period were not tested for blood-alcohol content.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The study also expressed concern about the use of paracetamol and antidepressants in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Paracetamol was used in 13 percent of overdose deaths and 20 percent were associated with antidepressants. But the study said the high proportion of antidepressants found in overdose deaths could have been attributed to the fact the victims had been under treatment for depression.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The study found unemployed people had the highest rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for males at 86 per 100,000. Of those who were employed, labourers (33.8 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000), managers (27.9 per 100,000) and salespeople (25.4 per 100,000) had the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The study said there were 27 murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Queensland in the 1990-95 study period._ SID MAHER

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day will be observed on Wednesday (September 10) to promote worldwide action to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Various events and activities are held on the occasion to raise awareness that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a major preventable cause of premature death. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day gives organizations, government agencies and individuals a chance to promote awareness about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , mental illnesses associated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , as well as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Organizations such as the International Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention (IASP) and World Health Organization (WHO) play a key role in promoting this event.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The theme for 2014 is "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention: One World Connected". Studies have shown that social isolation can increase the risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and, conversely, that having strong human bonds can be protective against it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nearly 3000 people on average commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  daily, according to WHO. For every person who completes a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , 20 or more may attempt to end their lives.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 About one million people die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year across the globe.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 WHO's role is to build political action and leadership to develop national responses to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , strengthen national planning capacity to establish the core building blocks of such a national response, and build the national capacities to implement these responses.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The WHO analyzed 10 years of research and data on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from around the world, involving 172 countries. It was found out that around 800,000 people kill themselves every year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It was the 15th leading cause of death for 2012 all over the world; second among young people, aged 15 to 29.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The WHO aims to reduce the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by at least 10 percent by 2020.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Despite the staggering statistics, only 28 countries have policies that aim to reduce \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is encouraged that all governments should set up national prevention plans for early identification and management of people who abuse drugs and people with mental illness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Doing so is a major challenge especially in the case of low-income countries where budget is tight and people are more vulnerable to a string of pressures because of poverty.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day will be 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 observed on Wednesday (September 10) to promote worldwide action to 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       Various events and activities are held on the occasion to raise 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 awareness that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a major preventable cause of premature death. 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0       World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day gives organizations, government agencies 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 and individuals a chance to promote awareness about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , mental illnesses associated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , as well as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       Organizations such as the International Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention (IASP) and World Health Organization (WHO) play a key role in promoting this event.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       The theme for 2014 is "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention: One World Connected".      Studies have shown that social isolation can increase the risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and, conversely, that having strong human bonds can be protective against it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       Nearly 3000 people on average commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  daily, according to WHO. For every person who completes a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , 20 or more may attempt to end their lives.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    About one million people die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year across the globe. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       WHO's role is to build political action and leadership to develop national responses to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , strengthen national planning capacity to establish the core building blocks of such a national response, and build the national capacities to implement these responses.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       The WHO analyzed 10 years of research and data on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from around the world, involving 172 countries. It was found out that around 800,000 people kill themselves every year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       It was the 15th leading cause of death for 2012 all over the world; second among young people, aged 15 to 29.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       The WHO aims to reduce the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by at least 10 percent by 2020. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    Despite the staggering statistics, only 28 countries have policies that aim to reduce \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       It is encouraged that all governments should set up national prevention plans for early identification and management of people who abuse drugs and people with mental illness. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       Doing so is a major challenge especially in the case of low-income
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 countries where budget is tight and people are more vulnerable to a string of pressures because of poverty.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 GUIDELINES TO encourage the responsible reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by the media have been updated to include advice on the reporting of murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and so-called copycat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The guidelines from the Samaritans and the Irish Association of Suicidology also include information on working with bereaved families, understanding \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the online treatment of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  topics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There have been a number of murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in recent years, all of which generated significant media coverage. The guidelines say there is evidence that the reporting of murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can lead to  copycat  events.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Great care must be taken to have a balanced approach to reporting these very tragic events,  the guidelines state.  For elements of the media, they seem to provide a licence to indulge in idle speculation, misinformation and wild fantasy. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They express  major concern  at the way survivors and extended families who are still in shock  can be exploited by the media to make  good  television and news stories .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On  copycat  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the guidelines point out that up to 13 per cent of teenage \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occur in clusters. They say that certain ways of describing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the news contribute to  copycat  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They note a newspaper report in Hong Kong that gave a detailed description of the method used by a person who died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Within three years, the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  using that method had increased from zero to 10 per cent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In another case, a German television series that depicted the railway \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of a young man at the start of each episode was blamed for a 175 per cent rise in railway \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in young people during and after the series.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The guidelines advise against giving explicit details of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  method used and say that the media should avoid giving simplistic explanations for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 FEWER people are dying by their own hand but more are ending up in hospital after attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , new figures show. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Trends, released by the Health Ministry yesterday, details patterns in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempts over the 20 years from 1983 to 2003.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While self-inflicted deaths rose from 465 in 2002 to 526 in 2003, three-yearly averages show \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  death rates have dropped by 15 per cent since the mid to late 1990s.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, the number of people being admitted to hospital for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts has increased nearly 24 per cent since the mid-1980s.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Canterbury \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Project principal investigator Annette Beautrais said the figures indicated better treatment for suicidal people. While available data did not include medical information, the most likely explanation was that more people were being admitted for a full psychiatric assessment and management plan following \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Trends report, 25 to 34-year-olds had the highest rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , with men three times more likely to kill themselves than women. However, women were more likely than men to be hospitalised for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Maori, especially men under 35 years, and those living in low socioeconomic areas had the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Associate Health Minister Jim Anderton said there was no room for complacency, despite declining \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates. "When you see the increase in attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  . . . you know there is still much to be done."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A 10-year \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategy, announced in June, aims to cut \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in all age groups. A five-year action plan to implement stage one of the strategy is to be released next year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  research network and national depression initiative is also to be established.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The American Foundation for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention, the American Association of Suicidology and the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania released "Reporting on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide:\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Recommendations for the Media" in August 2001. Here are excerpts of the report's suggestions and tips for journalists. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Descriptions of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the news that contribute to copycat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides:\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Inadvertently romanticizing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or...portraying \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as a heroic or romantic act may encourage others to identify with the victim.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Exposure to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  methods through media reports can encourage vulnerable individuals to imitate it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Presenting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as the inexplicable act of an otherwise healthy or high-achieving person may encourage identification with the victim.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Celebrity deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are more likely than non-celebrity deaths to produce imitation... [I]t is important not to let the glamour of the individual obscure any mental health problems or use of drugs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Research has shown that the use in headlines of the word \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or referring to the cause of death as self-inflicted increases the likelihood of contagion.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Information the media should include:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Conveying that effective treatments for most of these conditions are available (but underutilized) may encourage those with such problems to seek help.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Acknowledging the deceased person's problems and struggles as well as the positive aspects of his/her life or character contributes to a more balanced picture.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Stories to consider covering:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Trends in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Recent treatment advances
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Individual stories of how treatment was life-saving
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Stories of people who overcame despair without attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Myths about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Warning signs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Department of Defense Releases Fourth Quarter \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Information
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In its efforts to better understand \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among all its components, the Department of Defense released its first quarterly \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  report (QSR), today, for the four quarters of 2013. The report summarizes \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  counts and annual rates for the active component, reserves, and National Guard. Additionally, the QSR shows calendar year 2013 quarterly \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  counts, annual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  counts, and annual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates for each of the services. It also reports 2012 annual counts and annual rates as published in the department's 2012 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Event Report (DoDSER) annual report. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Department of Defense considers one loss to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  too many, and will continue to do everything possible to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in our military. The QSR is intended to communicate the department's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  data on a routine and frequent basis. A breakdown of 2013 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  counts by quarter and resources for service members and their families, who may be facing challenges, can be found at: http: //www.suicideoutreach.org/SuicideData/QuarterlyReports.aspx

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in Seoul increased in proportion to the amount of sunshine last year, the Seoul Fire and Disaster Management Department said in a report yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate was lowest in the winter but gradually increased in the spring, when there is more sun, and reached its peak in the summer, according to the report.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts increased to 2,610 cases last year from 2,517 in 2000. But those dead declined to 136 people from 152, whereas casualties rose to 2,321 from 2,110. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 By season, the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts increased in March (241 cases), peaked in July (263 cases), conspicuously declined in October (191 cases) and hit the bottom in December (154 cases).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate by season in 2000 showed a similar trend with that of last year, the department said. The trend corresponds to the recent report by Harvard University, which stated that sunshine induces \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , it said. The university obtained this result after comparing the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in some 20 countries with the amount of monthly sunshine.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The decline in the number of dead people despite the increased \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases is attributed to the drop in the number of people who fell off bridges into the Han River, which decreased to 137 from 154. On the other hand, the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  committed inside homes increased. Hanging and cutting arteries declined, whereas drug poisoning increased to 1,229 cases from 1,008.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 By sex, women committed more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than men, as in 2000, accounting for 1,401 cases compared with 1,209 cases. By age, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate of female teenagers was more than twice that of male teens, while the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate of women in their 20s greatly exceeded that of their male counterparts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But the gap in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate narrowed between women and men in their 30s, and the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate of men in their 40s outpaced that of women of the same age.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, the highest number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was committed in 1998, when Korea was hit by the financial crisis, at 3,003 cases. With the recovery of the domestic economy, the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases plunged to 2.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A Canterbury \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  expert says strict firearms regulations introduced in the 1990s have helped greatly to reduce \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  involving guns. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was a main focus of the third day of the international firearms safety seminar being held in Christchurch yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Canterbury \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Project head Dr Annette Beautrais told the seminar that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by firearms had decreased by 46 per cent since the 1992 Arms Amendment Act.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The act introduced photographic licences with more stringent safety testing, checks on the behaviour of the licence applicant and stricter rules about the securing and storage of guns.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Beautrais said firearms \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for 15 to 24 year-olds had decreased by 66% in the same period.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This research clearly demonstrates that tighter gun laws in New Zealand have saved lives when it comes to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, 2003 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  figures released this week showed a 10% jump in the total number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Beautrais said restricting access to methods of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was the second-most effective way of preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The most effective was improving the training of medical professionals in identifying at-risk patients.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 New Zealand's decline in firearm \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to about 10% of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was very positive when compared to the United States, where about 60% of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were firearm-related.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lifeline Canterbury clinical manager Fiona Robertson said support organisations also played a critical role in preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, addresses from American speakers John Lott and Mark Barnes went ahead without any disruption at the seminar yesterday. The possibility of a protest had arisen after Green MP Keith Locke publicly opposed the presence of several of the speakers labelling them pro-gun lobbyists.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The biggest item on the wish list of Ted Charette, co-ordinator of Youth Services Bureau of Ottawa Mobile Crisis and Intake Services, is Canada adopting a national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategy. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Canada is the only G-8 country without a national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Canadian Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention is working on preparing a national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I think it's starting to gain some weight and some support around the families," says Charette.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We've had a blueprint for many, many years," says Rene Ouimet, a director of the Canadian Mental Health Association and a member of the Canadian Association of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Canada needs a body to co-ordinate \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention programs across the country, said Ouiment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We keep lobbying," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Canadian Association of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention released a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategy in 2004.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The objectives of the strategy include: Promote awareness across the country that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and suicidal behaviour is everyone's problem and is preventable.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Increase the number of employers and volunteer groups that have \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, intervention and post-intervention programs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Promote understanding that "breaking the silence surrounding \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  increases realistic opportunities to save lives and to reduce suffering.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Launch an anti-stigma campaign.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Reduce the availability and lethality of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  methods (such as guns).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Increase training for recognition of risk factors, warning signs and at-risk behaviours.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Develop a national crisis-line network.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Increase services and support to those bereaved by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or who have attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Increase funding for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention programs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The only way we're going to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is to talk about it openly and directly," said Ouimet.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The theme for 2014 is "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention: One World Connected". Studies have shown that social isolation can increase the risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and, conversely, that having strong human bonds can be protective against it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nearly 3000 people on average commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  daily, according to WHO. For every person who completes a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , 20 or more may attempt to end their lives.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 About one million people die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year across the globe.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 WHO's role is to build political action and leadership to develop national responses to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , strengthen national planning capacity to establish the core building blocks of such a national response, and build the national capacities to implement these responses.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The WHO analyzed 10 years of research and data on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from around the world, involving 172 countries. It was found out that around 800,000 people kill themselves every year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It was the 15th leading cause of death for 2012 all over the world; second among young people, aged 15 to 29.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The WHO aims to reduce the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by at least 10 percent by 2020.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Despite the staggering statistics, only 28 countries have policies that aim to reduce \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is encouraged that all governments should set up national prevention plans for early identification and management of people who abuse drugs and people with mental illness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Doing so is a major challenge especially in the case of low-income

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 KARACHI, Sept. 10 -- The trend of committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is on the rise in Pakistan as 751 cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were reported from January to June 2012 from across the country, said a statement issued by Madadgar National Helpline on Saturday. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sharing the findings on the eve of World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, the Madadgar National Helpline said that in the last six months 136 children, 303 women and 312 men took their own lives.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The data also revealed that as many as 32,762 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the country during the last 12 years (2001-12). The victims included 4,031 children, 11,752 women and 16,975 men.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The data was compiled from news reports published in various national and local newspapers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, Madadgar believes that the figures could be higher since the data it collected was based on the cases that were reported. "In many instances, the families of victims are reluctant to register cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , as it is considered a social stigma," said the statement. It was found that men are more likely to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than women.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The data showed that there was a co-relation between poor socio-economic conditions and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Pakistan. Domestic violence, poverty, insecurity, and hopelessness are the most common reasons for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Poisoning, firearms, hanging, excess use of medicines or sleeping pills, use of insecticides and jumping from height are the most common methods of committing and attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Zia Ahmed Awan, president of the Lawyers for Human Rights and Legal Aid (LHRLA), regretted the rising incidents of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said the lack of basic civic facilities, dearth of resources, poorly established healthcare services and political instability made \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention an alarming challenge in Pakistan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Under Section 325 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), attempt to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is punishable with simple imprisonment for a term of one year or with fine or both. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is forbidden in Islam as well.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Traditionally, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases in Islamic societies remained very low but recently we see a sharp rise in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases, which has become a major problem in Pakistan," Awan said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Commenting on ways of controlling the epidemic, he said that collective efforts of families, civil society, the government, media, law enforcement agencies, healthcare and other related departments were needed in reducing the incidence of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There is a dire need to develop and implement a community-based \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention programme. A National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Statistics should be compiled at government level and the government needs to develop policy frameworks for chalking out \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategies."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Awan also said that the media could play a vital role in preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . "There is dire need to convey people who want to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to choose something other than ending their life to solve their problems.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The tactic of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  terrorism has long been employed by certain types of terrorist groups, particularly (although not exclusively) those that are religiously-based, as an important modus operandi in their warfare. In recent times, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  terrorism, which characterizes much of terrorist operations in regions such as the Middle East and Afghanistan/Pakistan, has expanded to include the Russian Federation, with the Caucasus Emirate (CE) and its affiliated groupings making worldwide headlines when they deployed cells of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  operatives -- whether males or females known as "black widows" -- to detonate themselves prior to holding the Sochi Olympics in February 2014.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In response, an estimated 60,000 security personnel-strong 'ring of steel' was erected by Russian security services around the Olympic games' sites, which succeeded in deterring and foiling additional \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombing operatives from succeeding in their attacks, thereby depriving the perpetrating groups of the worldwide publicity they had sought for their cause.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 With the tactic of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombings continuing to be extensively employed against civilian and military targets in high intensity war zones such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, what is the nature of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  martyrdom bombings and how do they differ from 'conventional' terrorist tactics? 
\par \pard 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Defining \cf17 Suicide\cf  Terrorism\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  terrorism is a premeditated tactic in warfare in which the attacker detonates an explosive that is strapped to one's body with the premeditated intention to kill himself (or herself) together with as many victims as possible, in order to spread fear and panic beyond the incident to the wider society, and coerce the targeted adversary to pay attention and concede to the perpetrating group's grievances and demands. The crucial element that differentiates the tactic of '\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide'\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from 'conventional' terrorist warfare is that in the former no escape is intended for the attacker who is deliberately recruited for that purpose, while, in the latter, although the attacker is aware that his death is likely, he still expects to be able to escape from the scene of the incident and resume warfare later on.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For religiously-based terrorist groups -- and particularly those that are Islamic -- by conducting such \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  operations once the 'martyr' is killed the perpetrator (whether male or female) is considered entitled to special status in paradise and on Judgment Day, including special benefits (which in some cases, are monetary) and honors for his/her family in the community.
\par \pard 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Role of Groups is Crucial\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attacks are commissioned by organized groups directly or even by what are termed self-starter cells. In the case of one such self-starter cell that had conducted the July 2005 bombing of London's transportation system, their leaders were recruited, trained and instructed by senior al Qaeda operatives in Pakistan prior to their return to England. This is one of the reasons why the December 2013 Volgograd \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombers -- even though their identities and affiliations were not known -- were likely aided in conducting their operation by their group's accomplices, just as any potential \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombers during the Sochi Olympics likely would have been aided by their group's supporting infrastructure.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Organized groups are essential in mobilizing and deploying \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  operatives because it is easier for such organized entities to transform susceptible individuals into becoming martyrdom bombers for their cause by radicalizing, recruiting, indoctrinating, training and arming them, sometimes even in a matter of a few days. Prior to their operations, a group will videotape the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  operative's martyrdom statement, with such videos extensively used in their post-attack propaganda campaigns. It was likely, therefore, that if \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  operatives had been underway during the Sochi Olympics that their martyrdom statements would have already been videotaped and were awaiting their broadcast via the groups' online media venues.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Groups that employ \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombers in their operations get their 'oxygen' from extremist religions and ideologies that glorify martyrdom into an afterlife in that religion's version of paradise -- which is a concrete reality in the communities where these bombers are indoctrinated. It is important to note that such religious justifications for martyrdom operations are not specific to any single extremist variant of religious or political ideology, with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  terrorist operations conducted over the past several decades by widely disparate groups ranging from the Sri Lankan Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), the Syrian Social Nationalist Party in Lebanon (SSNP), as well as the Lebanese Hizballah, the Palestinian Hamas, al Qaida and its affiliates, the Taliban, as well as the Caucasus Emirate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A spectrum of grievances -- whether legitimate under international law or alleged -- against their adversaries motivate terrorist violence in general. For the cult of death through \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  martyrdom to succeed -- especially for its operatives to voluntarily and intentionally give up their lives for their group's cause -- it must be reinforced by the group through intensive indoctrination and hate propaganda among its supporting community, whether in religious houses of worship or political clubs, schools, media and even music such as customized 'urban rap' which is popular among the young generation that is recruited for such intentional self-death operations.
\par \pard 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Tactical and Strategic Benefits?\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While the destructiveness of all types of terrorist attacks is calculated to produce specific political benefits for the group's cause, what makes the tactic of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombing so attractive to their organizing groups is the willingness of their operatives to die, with the chances for the attack to succeed increasing by their ability to maneuver 'intelligently' toward their intended targets and catch them completely off-guard and unprepared to prevent their bombing, unlike a 'conventional' attack in which an operative would leave an explosive bomb at the incident's location, which could be detected as a suspicious package. This is especially the case when a government's security measures are in place that restrict the movement of a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  operative toward one target but not another one that may be less protected, thus making such operatives human directional 'smart bombs'.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While tactically beneficial for their organizing groups, such \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  operations produce few strategic benefits with no \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombings-dominated campaigns ever leading to the defeat of their targeted government. A terrorist group such as Hizballah, for example, was generally more effective militarily when it resorted to conventional tactics against the Israeli military in southern Lebanon in the late 1990s, which was also the case in its Summer 2006 war with Israel in which it fired an estimated 4,000 rockets into Israel (and in which it succeeded in killing 44 Israeli civilians and118 soldiers), and Hamas' firing of rockets and mortars into Israel in 2007-08 caused substantially more physical and psychological damage on its targeted populations than its previous campaigns of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attacks (with an estimated 80 percent or more of such attacks thwarted by Israeli security services in the past). Similarly, al Qaeda's affiliates in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, as well as the Taliban in Afghanistan, while extensively employing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombings in their warfare, also organize themselves into guerrilla units that engage government forces in battle, with their success in such battles enabling them to expand the territories under their control in the those countries.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is for this reason that the effectiveness of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombing attacks should not be overestimated, and which explains why not all major terrorist operations involve \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  tactics. For example, in the March 2004 bombing of trains in Madrid, which killed 191 persons, the attackers did not intentionally blow themselves up at the time -- they did so only later when they were about to be captured. In other major terrorist incidents, Times Square bomber Faisal Shahzad attempted to escape from the scene in his early May 2010 bombing operation, Nidal Hasan apparently did not try to kill himself as a martyr at his shooting rampage at Fort Hood, Texas in November 2009, and the Boston Marathon bombers attempted to escape from the scene of their bombing operation in mid-April 2013. This is not, however, intended to downplay the significance of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombing tactics, with Al Qaeda's use of aircraft to conduct their martyrdom operations against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on 9/11 stark reminders of the catastrophic devastation that such martyrdom tactics can produce.
\par \pard 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Future Trends\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Regarding future trends, it is instructive that the widely expected \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombing attacks by Islamist terrorists did not occur during the Sochi Olympics, due to the effectiveness of the Russian security services' 'ring of steel' erected to protect not only the games' sites but to prevent these groups from attacking soft targets in nearby geographical locations. Moreover, as previously discussed, the primary components of warfare against Israel by terrorist organizations such as Hamas and Hizballah now focus on launching rockets -- rather than the deployment of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  operatives -- against Israeli targets. In fact, in November 2013, and again in January 2014, Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad attempted to place explosives on board Israeli buses, with the operatives escaping from those buses prior to the detonation of the bombs, rather than dispatching \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombers. This does not imply that the Palestinian groups had given up on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  warfare, with several plots involving such a tactic uncovered by the Israeli security services, but that their primary warfare remained the launching of rockets from their safe haven in the Gaza Strip against neighboring Israeli towns and cities (and with the Israelis uncovering a large shipment of such rockets on board a ship destined for these groups in early March 2014).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In conclusion, the tactic of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombings is likely to continue to be employed by terrorist groups worldwide, although even in high-intensity conflict zones such as Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, the terrorist insurgents realize that such tactics have to be accompanied by guerrilla warfare that is effective in battling government forces to increase the territory under rebel control.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 High \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates among New Zealand men have sparked calls for a national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -prevention strategy targeting adults.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The latest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  figures for 2000, released by the Ministry of Health yesterday, show 458 Kiwis took their own lives in 2000, a drop from 516 in 1999 and 577 in 1998.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The highest number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was in the 25-29 age group. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Most (375) were males compared with 83 females.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The highest rate of hospitalisations from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts was in the 15-24 age group.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Canterbury \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  also appeared to be tracking down.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Statistics released to The Press for the first time show there were 56 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2000, compared with 51 in 1999, 64 in 1998, and 86 in 1997.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Christchurch School of Medicine \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  researcher Annette Beautrais said New Zealand was the only developed country without a strategy to prevent adult \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Half of all the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are in the male 25 to 55 age group," she said. "We aren't actually doing anything about it and we ought to be."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Beautrais said the country's youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  strategy had helped reduce youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We got off to a very good start by developing the youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  strategy. But overseas there is an emerging interest in adult \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One health organisation in the United States has developed a website for male adults focusing on depression and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as part of its prevention strategy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Beautrais said there was the potential for similar initiatives in New Zealand.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There has been an enormous amount of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  research since the 1990s. But we need a framework to operate under. It would be a good opportunity for us to actually use that information in a strategy for all ages," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ministry of Health spokeswoman Maria Cotter said the ministry was looking at adult and elderly \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It was probably a bit early to say whether an all-age \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategy would be developed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "That is a Government decision," Ms Cotter said. "I share (Dr Beautrais') concerns that there needs to be a greater focus on all ages."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The events that took place in Moncton last month received plenty of media attention, not only from traditional media outlets, but also from social media.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Without social media, perhaps people wouldn't have been warned as quickly to stay away from the affected area. On the flip side, perhaps social media inadvertently allowed the wanted person to stay away from police. Perhaps social media could also have played a role in encouraging copycat events. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A bit far-fetched you say? Allow me to explain.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is a well-known link between heavy media coverage of a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and a spike in the number of similar \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  afterward. In the case of school shootings, since many shootings end with the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of the shooter (although this wasn't the case for the incident in Moncton) and since there seems to be an increase in shootings after a well-reported shooting, some suggest that a "copycat" effect similar to that of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  may exist for school shootings.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To combat the copycat effect on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  numbers, the Canadian Psychiatric Association has published guidelines for the media on reporting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . In news stories about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the guidelines suggest including information on warning signs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , how to approach a suicidal person, resources and treatment for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and emphasizing the positive outcome that can be obtained through treatment. The guidelines advocate avoidance of sensationalistic or excessive news coverage, idolization of the deceased, usage of the word "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," detailing the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  method used, and portraying \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in a positive light.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Canadian Psychiatric Association recommends that the guidelines on reporting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  be taught to journalism students.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Considering the increasing importance of social media, perhaps it is also important for the rest of us to be aware of the potential impact our social media updates may have and to keep in mind the guidelines concerning \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , which could also be applied to some shootings.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Perhaps awareness of the impact of media and social media on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and possibly shootings may help reduce the rates of these, saving precious lives.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 TWO events for World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day will be hosted by the Mental Health Association of Central Australia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One will be held in Alice Springs tomorrow at the memorial site on the lawns between the Senior Citizens Centre and the Totem Theatre from 3.30pm to 5pm. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The other event will be held at Nynkka Nyunyu Cultural Centre, in Tennant Creek, from 3.30pm to 5pm on Friday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The theme for World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day 2010 is ``Many Faces, Many Places, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Across the World'', recognising that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a major preventable cause of premature death that impacts on all nations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The event is part of an international initiative to raise public awareness of the severity of the problem of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but also to learn about effective \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention approaches in Central Australia and what support is out there for families and communities at a local level.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day is one day to have less silence and more understanding about the issue of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There are more deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Australia each year than by car accidents and for every \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  there are at least 20 people who try to end their lives.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Then there are all those people who are bereaved through \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , often contributing to a complex mix of emotions, unanswered questions, sometimes shame associated with the stigma of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and mental illness and sometimes family conflict, anger and blame.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The stigma, discrimination and misunderstanding that surround the subject of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  make it difficult for those struggling with suicidal thoughts to talk about their pain and reach out for support.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It also gets in the way of our ability to reach out and offer support for those who are struggling to stay connected to life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day is an opportunity to highlight that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can affect all of us.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It does not discriminate. It crosses class, gender, age and cultural boundaries.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For this reason, we all have a role to play in creating communities that are socially inclusive and to learn how we can be more supportive and less afraid of this issue.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 By speaking up rather than avoiding the issue of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and through the development of culturally appropriate resources to educate and increase awareness among people from different backgrounds we can help to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As there are educational campaigns to warn of the risks of drink driving and speeding as preventable causes of premature death, so too are there educational workshops to teach people to identify and intervene to keep someone safe from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Many \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be prevented.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Story is a training program developed by the Life Promotion Program of MHACA and Aboriginal people in the NT to teach people how to create \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  safer communities and families.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is important to acknowledge the families in remote and regional communities, night patrol workers, clinic staff, women's centres, schools, Councils, medical teams, youth workers, drug and alcohol, telephone counsellors and family violence workers who are providing support to people involved in self-harming behaviour on a regular basis.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is also important to acknowledge the community development, health promotion, prevention and early intervention work that build capacity and strength in communities and families.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At the end of an interview with actress Ellen DeGeneres, aired the night her lesbian television character "came out," anchor Diane Sawyer addressed viewers of "PrimeTime Live":
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "And as we close, we're going to repeat a government statistic that a gay teenager is some three times as likely to attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as another teenager. Ellen DeGeneres has said whatever happens to her, tonight's broadcast was in part to hold on to them."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's a "statistic" that's been repeated innumerable times. The trouble is, there is no scientifically valid evidence that it's true. In fact it is not a government statistic at all, but rather the interpretation of a social worker. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 So how did it come to be broadcast to a national television audience? Sawyer's office will say only that Sawyer got the number from DeGeneres.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Sawyer is not the only journalist who has reported the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  figure uncritically. Had she done a quick Nexis search, she would have found any number of newspapers--from the New York Times to the Chicago Times to the Los Angeles Times--quoting the "statistic" that gay and lesbian teens are two to three times more likely to attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and that they may account for 30 percent of the 5,000 youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  committed in the United States every year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This last number is the real attention-getter--often played up in drop quotes, graphics and cutlines. But according to Peter Muehrer of the National Institute of Mental Health, "There is no scientific evidence to support this figure." Nor is there any to support the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The real story is not at all as clear or dramatic as these figures imply.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A panel convened in 1994--with representatives of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institute of Mental Health, the American Psychological Association, the American Association of Suicidology, and gay and lesbian advocacy and service groups--made this finding: "There is no population-based evidence that sexual orientation and suicidality are linked in some direct or indirect manner."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Joyce Hunter, the immediate past president of the National Lesbian and Gay Health Association, participated in that 1994 meeting. Three years later, she says the data are still unclear.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Yet advocates for gays and lesbians still provide journalists with these numbers--and journalists still report them. And not without consequences.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The stunningly high number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  represented by these figures has shaped public perceptions of gay teens for nearly a decade. Typically they are portrayed as emotionally vulnerable and as society's victims, even though Hunter agrees with mental health researchers that most gay and lesbian teens, like teens overall, are emotionally resilient people who "go on to develop a positive sense of self and who go on with their lives."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But the conventional wisdom that gay teens are killing themselves has become so ingrained that it can influence public policy. Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, for instance, cited the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "statistic" as a driving force behind his state's creation of a Governor's Commission on Gay and Lesbian Youth.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Muehrer and his colleagues worry that the public focus on gay teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  might contribute to a phenomenon called "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  contagion," in which troubled gay teens might begin to see \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as an acceptable way out of their identity struggles.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to Howard Bray, director of the Knight Center for Specialized Journalism at the University of Maryland College of Journalism, the gay teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  figure illustrates an important lesson for journalists. He says it is critical to remember that, when it comes to statistics, journalists face a "minefield."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Victor Cohn, author of "News & Numbers: A Guide to Reporting Statistical Claims and Controversies in Health and Other Fields," suggests a remedy. "In a nutshell," Cohn says, "the most important question to ask anybody is, 'How do you know?' "
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If reporters had asked that question about the gay teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate, they would have learned that the "two to three times more likely to attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " and the "30 percent completed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " figures emerged from a 1989 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services task force report on youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  The numbers were drawn from a single essay written, at the department's invitation, by a San Francisco social worker named Paul Gibson.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Gibson did not base his numbers on original research, but rather on his own interpretation of available literature--literature that has since been criticized for methodological weaknesses. He concluded that gay and lesbian teens were two to three times more likely to attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and then went on to extrapolate that such a figure also would indicate that gay and lesbian teens may account for 30 percent of all teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Mental health researchers, however, consider \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts and actual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to be distinct phenomena.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although packaged in a government report, Gibson's paper was not government research, nor were his figures government statistics. But they were quickly picked up and presented as such by gay advocates and many reporters.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Gibson says he never intended for the 30 percent figure to be used as a statistic, but he stands by both numbers. "I think that there is ample evidence available to indicate that these youth are at risk and that we need to help them now," he says. "We can't wait to help these youth until complete information is available."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But reporters can certainly inform their readers when accurate information is elusive.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In such a case, Cohn suggests, reporters should be honest with their audience. If the study is tentative, say so. His general rule is this: "Understand that all studies are not equal, that just because someone said they've done a study or looked at something or made a count, that doesn't mean it's correct or worth possibly believing."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hyderabad, Sept. 11 -- Daily exposure to sunshine may cut down the risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in men, a new study has claimed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lower rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are associated with more daily sunshine in the 14 to 60 days prior to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  event, researchers said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Light interacts with brain serotonin systems and possibly influences serotonin-related behaviours, such as mood and impulsiveness, which can play a role in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , according to research author Benjamin Vyssoki, of the Medical University of Vienna, Austria, and colleagues.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The authors examined the relationship between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the duration of sunshine after mathematically removing seasonal variations in sunshine and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  numbers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They analysed data on 69,462 officially confirmed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Austria between January 1970 and May 2010. Hours of sunshine per day were calculated from 86 representative meteorological stations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There was a positive correlation between the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and hours of daily sunshine on the day of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and up to 10 days before that seemed to facilitate \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , while sunshine 14 to 60 days prior appeared to have a negative correlation and was associated with reduced \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The correlation between daily sunshine hours and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates was seen largely among women, while negative correlations between the two were mainly found among men.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Owing to the correlative nature of the data, it is impossible to directly attribute the increase in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to sunshine during the 10 days prior to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  event. Further research is warranted to determine which patients with severe episodes of depression are more susceptible to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -triggering effects of sunshine," said researchers.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  IT was more socially acceptable for Australian women to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 than men, a world \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  expert said in Brisbane yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The director of Griffith University's Australian Institute of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Research and Prevention, Professor Diego De Leo, said the incidence of
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among males was higher than females but the attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 rate for women was three times that of men. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "A failed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt among Australian men is judged harshly,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 whereas society is more sympathetic to women who attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ,"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Professor De Leo said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The implicit language of this behaviour is that if you're a man you
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 should be strong enough to kill yourself.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "In fact, women's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts are often used as a method of
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 communication."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates for men and women will be discussed at an institute
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 conference, entitled Towards an Evidence-based \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Management:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Linking Australia to the Rest of the World, at Griffith University's
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Conservatorium in Brisbane on Thursday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Professor De Leo, who has studied \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  trends around the globe,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 said culture played a key role in contributing to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Countries with similar cultures share similar \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates," he
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in Mediterranean populations are low among the young
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 but high among the elderly, whereas the reverse is true for
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Anglo-Saxon countries."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Professor De Leo said this was because of the availability of "social
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 support", which was especially strong for young people in
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mediterranean countries.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Professor De Leo described Australia's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate as "increasing
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 and alarming", with Queensland men aged 25 to 34 at the highest risk.

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hyderabad, Sept. 11 -- Daily exposure to sunshine may cut down the risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in men, a new study has claimed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lower rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are associated with more daily sunshine in the 14 to 60 days prior to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  event, researchers said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Light interacts with brain serotonin systems and possibly influences serotonin-related behaviours, such as mood and impulsiveness, which can play a role in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , according to research author Benjamin Vyssoki, of the Medical University of Vienna, Austria, and colleagues.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The authors examined the relationship between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the duration of sunshine after mathematically removing seasonal variations in sunshine and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  numbers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They analysed data on 69,462 officially confirmed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Austria between January 1970 and May 2010. Hours of sunshine per day were calculated from 86 representative meteorological stations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There was a positive correlation between the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and hours of daily sunshine on the day of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and up to 10 days before that seemed to facilitate \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , while sunshine 14 to 60 days prior appeared to have a negative correlation and was associated with reduced \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The correlation between daily sunshine hours and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates was seen largely among women, while negative correlations between the two were mainly found among men.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Owing to the correlative nature of the data, it is impossible to directly attribute the increase in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to sunshine during the 10 days prior to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  event. Further research is warranted to determine which patients with severe episodes of depression are more susceptible to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -triggering effects of sunshine," said researchers.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The New Mexico \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Coalition is devoted to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, intervention and postvention; and provides education, support and advocacy to reduce the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in New Mexico. As such we would like to congratulate the staff, editors and contributors to the May 18 edition of Generation Next, which addressed teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in a special report. The courage to investigate and report on a subject that is associated with severe stigma is to be heartily praised.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Research indicates that the way \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is reported in the media can contribute to additional \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts. Conversely, stories about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can inform readers and viewers about the likely causes of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , its warning signs, trends in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates and recent treatment advances. The contributors of the special report are playing a much-needed role in the destigmatization of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , which can reduce the incidence of such deaths and increase the willingness of individuals who are contemplating \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to seek help. Additionally, the report's coverage of factors associated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - depression, bullying, lack of resources, drug and alcohol abuse - assist in raising the awareness of other serious problems that could result in someone taking their own life. In New Mexico, as indicated by the message from Gov. Bill Richardson, we have resources available to help combat the state's problems with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The New Mexico \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Coalition's Web site is one such resource, with information on help lines, warning signs, how to recognize the signs of someone at risk, links to other sites for assistance, meeting times and places for Survivors of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  support groups and much, much more. We would like to encourage the youth of Generation Next to consider an expanded edition of the publication in which they investigate and further report on how teens can find help for the crises that too often lead to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Resource Center (www.sprc.org) has a wonderful selection of media guidelines and other resources on its online library. We would also like to see a section on how parents and other adults can better help during these times of crisis and where they can go to get more information. This would continue to aid in the reduction of stigma associated with mental illness, depression and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , as well as give people the tools they need to help prevent this tragic loss of life. Thank you for your efforts on behalf of raising the awareness of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among our youth. They are the "Generation Next": The next generation, the next in line, the next ones standing in life with promise, courage and commitment to help reduce this terrible number of lives lost to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Gandhinagar: A staggering 13,655 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were reported in Gujarat in three years - an average of 12 every single day - figures tabled by the Narendra Modi government in the legislative assembly show. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In fact, the number of total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is even higher as data of several places falling under the jurisdiction of police commissionerates was not revealed by the government.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The information shows that Ahmedabad rural registered 503 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from May 2010 to April 2013. However, the number was sharply lower compared to Rajkot rural and Jamnagar, which recorded as many as 1,200 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each in the same period.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In fact, other districts in Saurashtra region also registered a very high number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases. Junagadh accounted for 1,118 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the three-year period, whereas Bhavnagar registered 1,097 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases. Surendranagar district recorded 529 instances of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , followed by 432 and 377 cases in Amreli and Porbandar, respectively.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The government said in a written reply in the assembly that the 1090 helpline has been launched to dissuade those contemplating \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from taking the extreme step.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \'a6 SIR - Following on from Elaine Morgan's thought-provoking article about the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of David Kelly in 2003, it is indeed unusual for coroners to deliver a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  verdict where no \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  note is presented.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  As a consequence, the charity Papyrus - Prevention of Young \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , has little confidence that the official number of people who kill themselves is accurately counted. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Despite the under-reporting, the current annual estimate of 1,600-1,700 young deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the UK, is the single biggest cause of deaths among the young, even higher than road traffic accident fatalities. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In Wales one in five male deaths between the ages of 15 and 24 are the result of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but this is probably significantly underestimated. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Currently, the Welsh Assembly Government has an excellent five-year National Action Plan to Reduce \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Self-Harm in Wales. My fear is they will not have the resources to implement all the ideas and initiatives. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Today (September 10) is World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day jointly sponsored by the World Health Organisation and International Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  They want to encourage an open debate about the problem of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and effective \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention. It is a myth that talking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  encourages people to take their own lives, but media reporting has to be very sensitive. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  devastates families, friends and communities, but it can be prevented. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  If you are worried about yourself or a young person you know, please call Papyrus National Confidential Helpline 0800 068 4141 or the Samaritans on 08457 909090. ANNE OWEN TAYLOR Gilwern, Monmouthshire

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sometimes, the timing for my articles in Whatever works out perfectly, like last week's did, when an article published about the Region Medical Officer of Health coincided with a boil order issued by the RMOH. Other times, the timing isn't ideal. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The month of February was \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention month in New Brunswick. Although February 2011 is already gone and past, I nevertheless wanted to touch on the topic of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the second leading cause of death throughout the Canada for young people aged 10 to 24.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fortunately, I have no close family members or friends who have committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . However, I've always been sensitized to the topic. My mother once volunteered for a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  help line for about a year's time and whenever the topic of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and related mental health problems such as depression is broached, she sometimes reminisces on that experience, which was eye-opening for her.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to Dr. Said Bergheul, a professor of psychology at Universit\'e9 de Moncton, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a major problem in Canada and the Canadian government employs noteworthy efforts to counteract and reverse the climb of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that has been experienced over the past decades, in Canada and around the world. The increase in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates is thought to be in part caused by increasingly limited relationships between individuals living in large urban areas.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Durkheim, a sociologist, was the first form this hypothesis. Durkheim identified different types of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from a sociological point of view, but focused on what he called anomic \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  (\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  caused by a disintegration from society), which he believed was the main type of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  during the Industrial Period.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  often times has neuropsychological roots, which could be aggravated by the society in which an individual lives. In a more integrated society, people with mental disorders are typically better supported, which may help them manage their troubles.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The general approach to reducing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates is to take preventive measures, both in the very early stages by supporting individuals who are mentally well in continuing to be well and by quickly identifying and treating individuals who are likely to attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  acts when these people seek out health-care services.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If you or someone you know has been dealing with depression or suicidal thoughts, it is important to seek the help of a health-care professional for evaluation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr. Bergheul suggests that perhaps \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention could take a step further by offering more specialized counselling for the family and friends of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims, as these people are particularly vulnerable to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Some studies have also suggested that controlling the way \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is portrayed in the media can be an important part of prevention of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in society.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The programs are aimed at both training people in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention and helping those bereaved through \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Research shows that people who have lost a loved one by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are at a higher risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  themselves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Salvos who set up the world's first anti-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bureau in 1907 are launching the National Hope Line for bereaved and two online training programs to provide people with education and awareness in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention and support.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ``There are too many myths about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," a Salvos' spokesman said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ``It's a myth to think only experts can prevent it. It's a myth to think people who talk about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  won't do it. It's a myth to think you cannot stop \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  happening. It's a myth to think confronting people about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  may increase the risk. It's a myth to think suicidal people want to die.''

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Research indicates that the way \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is reported in the media can contribute to additional \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts. Conversely, stories about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can inform readers and viewers about the likely causes of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , its warning signs, trends in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates and recent treatment advances. The contributors of the special report are playing a much-needed role in the destigmatization of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , which can reduce the incidence of such deaths and increase the willingness of individuals who are contemplating \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to seek help. Additionally, the report's coverage of factors associated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - depression, bullying, lack of resources, drug and alcohol abuse - assist in raising the awareness of other serious problems that could result in someone taking their own life. In New Mexico, as indicated by the message from Gov. Bill Richardson, we have resources available to help combat the state's problems with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The New Mexico \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Coalition's Web site is one such resource, with information on help lines, warning signs, how to recognize the signs of someone at risk, links to other sites for assistance, meeting times and places for Survivors of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  support groups and much, much more. We would like to encourage the youth of Generation Next to consider an expanded edition of the publication in which they investigate and further report on how teens can find help for the crises that too often lead to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Resource Center (www.sprc.org) has a wonderful selection of media guidelines and other resources on its online library. We would also like to see a section on how parents and other adults can better help during these times of crisis and where they can go to get more information. This would continue to aid in the reduction of stigma associated with mental illness, depression and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , as well as give people the tools they need to help prevent this tragic loss of life. Thank you for your efforts on behalf of raising the awareness of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among our youth. They are the "Generation Next": The next generation, the next in line, the next ones standing in life with promise, courage and commitment to help reduce this terrible number of lives lost to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Visit the Web site at www.nmsuicideprevention.org and call 505-401-9382.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  HANGING had overtaken firearms and car exhausts as the most common method of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Australia, a major \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  conference was told yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Families National Conference on the Gold Coast also was told that "interactive" \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on the Internet were on the rise.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Associate Professor Pierre Baume, the founding director of the Australian Institute for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Research and Prevention, released new research showing there were about 2500 recorded \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a year in Australia. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But he said these were "only the tip of the iceberg", as there were likely to be many more that went unreported.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The research also showed Queensland ranked second in Australia in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates, behind the Northern Territory.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Professor Baume said Queensland had for many years had a "substantial problem" with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  because of the high proportion of rural areas in the state, where help was not readily available.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The research, undertaken from Griffith University, showed that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was the leading cause of death from all external causes for all age groups, well ahead of motor vehicle accidents and homicides.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In some states, the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among Aborigines was six times higher than that in the non-Aboriginal population.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Professor Baume said the Internet had become a medium for people wanting to kill themselves, with some Internet sites inciting people to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . An increasing number of young people were using interactive \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  notes to encourage each other to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the general community, only about 35 percent of people who killed themselves left \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  notes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The research showed that about four times as many males as females killed themselves; labourers had the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate of any occupation, followed by managers, tradespeople and machine operators; and more unemployed people killed themselves than people who worked.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the research, about half of the people who committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had alcohol in their system at the time.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Professor Baume said all attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  should be taken seriously because his research showed people who had previously tried to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were far more likely to kill themselves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The conference, at the Gold Coast International Hotel, ends tomorrow.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Strong links between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and poverty have been found in a study of more than 11,000 patients over more than 10 years in Bristol.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The findings suggest that improving the circumstances of the least well- off is at least as important as any activity by the National Health Service if the Government's Health of the Nation target of cutting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is to be achieved.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The link between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and unemployment, and possible links between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and poverty, have been the subject of intense debate. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has been increasing among young men and apparently rising in areas of sudden and high unemployment, although last year's figures do suggest an overall fall in the numbers killing themselves. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But a paper in this week's British Medical Journal shows powerful links, but not causative proof, that deprivation is strongly linked not only to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but to parasuicides - attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - and hospital admissions for acute mental illness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The findings follow analysis of almost 1,000 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the city over a 10-year period and the examination of thousands of hospital admissions for mental illness and parasuicide.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and parasuicide rates were between three and eight times higher in the inner city and other deprived wards of Bristol compared with the more pleasant wards, suburbs and surrounding towns. And there was a gradation - the higher the deprivation measures, the higher the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and parasuicide rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The difference persisted once allowance was made for age and sex differences between the different populations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  David Gunnell, a lecturer in public health medicine at the university, said the way the rates increased as areas became more deprived undermined past arguments that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates were higher in inner cities only because the mentally ill tended to be attracted there by hostels, council housing and the anonymity of inner-city life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Measures to decrease deprivation may therefore be more effective than health service interventions in preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The link between poverty, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  appeared the strongest one, over and above the well-known factors of women and young girls being more likely to attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and men more likely to succeed, with the highest rates among men in those over 75.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is 10 to 20 times more common than \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  although between 30 and 47 per cent of successful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have a history of past tries. Between 3 and 10 per cent of parasuicides go on to kill themselves within 10 years of an attempt.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Media reports of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  trigger further \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , according to an Adelaide study.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Professor Riaz Hassan, head of Flinders University's department of sociology, compared national statistics with the incidence of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  stories in two newspapers, The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The study found that the daily average \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate increased significantly in the days after \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were publicised.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Hassan used the Victorian State Library's index of stories to count the number of references to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in newspapers published between 1980 and 1990. Reports were categorised as "low impact" or "high impact" according to their position in the newspaper, their length, the headline, and whether photographs accompanied the story.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reports appeared in 288 issues over 10 years, with 148 "high-profile" stories.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Hassan looked at the incidence of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on the three days following the reports. The results showed a significant increase in the daily \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in the days following publication of a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  report, with higher rates linked to the appearance of "high-profile" stories.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Hassan said the newspaper reports were precipitating the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rather than causing them. "The presence of a report in the newspaper probably causes someone to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  earlier. (The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ) probably would have happened anyway," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The study is to be published in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Japan: the land of th e rising \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate BURIED among the latest statistics issued in Tokyo is an alarming suggestion that increasing numbers of Japanese may be setting fire to themselves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the National Fire Defence Board, 1986 saw a 22.2 per cent increase in the number of people committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with fire.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Listed under "Deaths by Fire" was the fact that 804 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with fire last year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But closer inquiries find that the new statistics do not indicate a rise in self-immolations. Rather they point to a general rise in the number of Japanese \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and a cultural quirk about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "with" fire instead of "by" fire. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with fire - when a person kills themselves by any method after setting fire to their home or valuables - is also related to the most tragic form of Japanese \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , that in which a person kills his or her young children before committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This killing of one's young before \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a horrifying but age-old Japanese practice. It is widely explained as a belief that, in a society which emphasises the family unit and has little sense of community welfare services being offered by the state, surviving children would face miserable lives without their parents.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hence a mother killing herself in protest at her husband's adultery might first kill the kids.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This practice is recognised by Japanese courts to the extent that a mother who kills her children and then survives her own \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt will not be charged with murder. The whole act is seen as a failed joint \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and even American courts have used this cultural interpretation when dealing with such Japanese family tragedies in the States.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Multiple \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are relatively common in Japan, where 490 of last year's 25,524 listed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were classified as group \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Those figures do not include the child victims of such family \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and unwilling adult partners in multiple \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Japanese language has terms for all these types of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The "shinju" or group/double \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  include "boshi shinju" involving a mother and children, "oyako shinju" when both parents \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and take some of their children, and "ikka shinju" or \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of the whole family.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Group \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  other than a family's are "shudan jisatsu".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to Prof Kenji Tamura, of Toyo University's sociology department, the important thing to distinguish about the fire \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the difference between "shoshin jisatsu" or self-immolation, and "hoka jisatsu" which means \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "with" fire.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Immolation as a means of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is not that popular in Japan, he says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Hanging is most popular and jumping is also very big. In recent years city people have also been using drugs and gas.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Guns are not often used in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , largely because of Japan tougher gun laws.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The big cultural cliche of Japanese seppuku or harakiri, ritual disembowelment is almost non-existent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Since the war there have been only two or three cases of seppuku, with the most recent being the 1970 and 1975 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of two extremist authors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The kamikaze pilots of the Pacific War also helped to embed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  into foreign stereotypes of Japanese behaviour.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But although Japanese \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates are high when compared to Australia's, they are certainly not the highest in the world.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Japan's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in 1986 was 21 out of 100,000 people, compared to 11 in Australia (1984 figures), 12.1 in the US, 0.2 in Egypt and 44.9 in Hungary (all 1980 figures).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Prof Tamura argues that the Japanese \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  practices of killing young children and using fire both result from the Japanese sense of self or identity.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Japanese people identify very strongly with the home and children, which form an unusually central part of the Japanese self-image," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Japanese home is extremely private, akin to a Westerner's bedroom. Friends are rarely invited into a Japanese home, partly as a result of simple logistics - most Japanese have tiny homes - and partly because of the very personal view of the home.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Japanese have one word "jibun" to mean one's self and another "bunshin" to cover "one's other self", which can equally mean one's home or one's children.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "So when people want to destroy themselves they might also kill their children or destroy their home," Prof Tamura said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There is also a general Japanese belief in an after-life and fire is a traditional tool of purification."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kudos for dealing with reckless drivers
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kudos to St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert P. McCulloch for charging Mary Lott with involuntary manslaughter in the death of Missouri Department of Transportation worker Kenneth Hoierman ("Motorist is charged in death of highway worker," Dec. 9). This is a courageous step when it is next to impossible to convict drivers in a society in which many people still view fatal car crashes as accidents instead of the completely preventable tragedies that most are.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We need laws that make it easier for the judicial system to deal appropriately with all reckless drivers, not just those who have enough alcohol or drugs in their blood to get convicted, or those who kill highway workers. Dealing appropriately with reckless drivers should involve a combination of incarceration, fines and loss of driving privileges.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The latter, despite what most people still think, is not necessarily punishment, at least not in the conventional sense of the word. Many people do not need a car to get around, even in St. Louis. Those of us who love bicycles could show so many what a joy it is not to drive.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Reporting on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  should include prevention
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Regarding "People are wondering, who's next?" (Dec. 10): It is understandable that stories about individual deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  might be newsworthy to the local community and need to be covered. In response, the American Foundation for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention along with the Annenberg Public Policy Center and others have developed recommendations to encourage responsible, accurate and informative reporting about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These reports should explain the real causes of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , list \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  warning signs, include expert opinions and where someone can go for help if they are feeling depressed or suicidal. Reports should avoid describing the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  method or sensationalizing the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although the article delves deeply into the tragic deaths of these four teenage boys lost to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and discusses the fear of contagion, it misses a real opportunity to inform the public about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and ways to prevent it. For example, research shows that more than 90 percent of people who die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have an underlying (although not always diagnosed) psychiatric illness at the time of their death. We also know that the best way to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is education and vigorous treatment of depression and other mental illnesses that can lead to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Irony of Iraq milestones
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That war itself seems a natural part of human existence perhaps teaches us about the symmetry of justice, like an echo coming back. That sound reverberated as I listened to the Iraq Study Group pronounce repeatedly and emphatically the need for Iraq to institute "milestones." Ironically, it is the book "Milestones" that terrorism experts claim is the manifesto for Osama bin Laden's movement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Written by Egyptian writer and activist Sayyid Qutb during his political imprisonment in the late 1950s, "Milestones" argues almost mystically against modern materialism. The book was published in 1964, but was banned as treasonous. Two years later, Qutb was hanged by the Egyptian government when he refused to renounce his beliefs, declaring, "The time has come for a Muslim to give his head in order to proclaim the birth of the Islamic Movement."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For the neo-conservative and evangelical Americans who have fostered the predicted "clash of civilizations" - the West versus the Muslim world - the Iraq commission's ironic insistence on "milestones" may eerily signal that the West has come full circle to defeat.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 James Baker and the others nobly seek to avoid the abyss that lies beyond this, but the invasion and occupation of Iraq have not been only a military miscue, but also an act of injustice. The commission's 79 recommendations might correct the former, but something more will have to come around to right the latter.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Prevent wider conflagration
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Iraq Study Group's report is an effort to think of something, change course somehow, to prevent an American defeat in Iraq, but it's too late for that. The American military effort has reached the end of its ability to affect a situation that has descended into anarchy and civil war.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The ISG's critics argue that we cannot expect diplomacy with Iran and Syria to be of any help in winning the war. That is correct because the Bush war already is lost. The impelling imperative to communicate with Iraq's neighbors is to prevent our failed foreign policy from turning into a wider conflagration that envelops the entire region. That goal is achievable. Iran and Syria have a vested interest in seeing it achieved, and we have no time to waste in inaugurating such an effort.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At home, our best hope is diplomacy. Perhaps a senior bipartisan group of the new Democratic congressional leaders and what's left of the Republican leadership should meet with the president, again and again if necessary, to go to the mat in convincing him that he must get over himself and face the facts. The election is over, and the nation's best interest demands statesmanship.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We should declare a cease-fire in hopes that it will be reciprocated, begin withdrawal of U.S. combat troops and name a time for them to be gone from Iraq, not in 2008, but by summer or fall of next year.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The appeasing adults
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When will the media stop fawning over the consultation of James Baker by the Bush administration? The media now love the so-called "realists" of the first Bush administration, now anointed as the "adults." The release of the Iraq Study Group report shows what are "adult" positions: the appeasement of dictators and murderous terrorists by throwing whatever you can at the terrorists and their enablers if they will just go away (except, of course, that they do not go away, they keep coming back for more). That includes sacrificing our one true friend and the only liberal democracy in the entire Middle East, Israel. But Israel is not enough, so let's give them Lebanon, too. This is what passes for realism? Buying off terrorists who have proved that buying them off just emboldens them?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is what we should expect of Mr. Baker. In 1991, Mr. Baker and the first Bush administration demonstrated that realism means a willingness to throw your friends under the bus. During the Gulf War, Israel absorbed countless unprovoked Scud missile attacks from Iraq without any response. It did so at the urging of the United States and despite its best instincts that absorbing such attacks only leads to more. Israel was correct; the non-response led to more attacks. To repay Israel for its compliance with U.S. strategy, those solons Mr. Baker and then-President George H.W. Bush repaid Israel by forcing the Oslo Accords and Yassir Arafat on Israel, resulting in a decade and a half of unrelenting terrorism and the build-up of Hamas and Hezbollah, putting Israel's existence at even more risk.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Spare us the "realists." They embolden enemies and abandon friends every time.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mink: Finally right
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I never, ever have agreed with anything Eric Mink has written, and usually I find his views irritating. My hat is tipped to him, however, on his "Storm debris" (Dec. 6) column. He is correct in his assessment of the lameness of AmerenUE's excuses and the failure of its management. Somehow, area residents need to be given the option of buying their electric power from other suppliers. Service could not be worse, and the competition for customers only could make it better.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Stan Viglione | Ballwin
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Rash response
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is disturbing when so many people lose power. But more disturbing is the illogical thinking of some people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 People said AmerenUE should have trimmed trees more aggressively. But when huge limbs succumb to the immense weight of water, that "aggressive" tree-trimming would require almost all trees by power lines to be cut down.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 People are mad at Ameren about the Taum Sauk reservoir, but Ameren executives immediately accepted responsibility.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 People complain that Ameren's response to this storm was inadequate. But it is in Ameren's best interest to get everyone back online as soon as possible. Ameren was not getting money for a half million customers, and it paid thousands of linemen to travel hundreds of miles to work in icy-cold conditions to get the power back on. Ameren has everything to gain from a quick response. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I see no legitimate complaint against Ameren, although I see rash human thinking on the consumers' parts.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Offensive words
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Post-Dispatch devoted a large amount of space lately to the issue of whether or not the N-word is offensive. Editors and writers understand that while some people are comfortable using what historically has been an extremely offensive insult to African-Americans, the word is not appropriate for a headline or for everyday usage in a major metropolitan newspaper. The word offends many, and for good reason.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 So if the Post-Dispatch believes that words do carry meaning, especially those words that have been associated with the exploitation and abuse of a group of people, why did no one object to the headline "Pimp your house" (Dec. 9)? It's absurd and offensive to associate this word with what is for many people a spiritual and family-centered time of year. "Pimp" conjures only one meaning for anyone who doesn't use this word in everyday speech. The Post-Dispatch should not insult readers by using this word as if it no longer is offensive to women. It worries me to think of what the paper may resort to next to appear hip.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This very act of taking one's own life is called \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . It is a very tragic event and with far reaching impact on the family of the victims and society.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sadly, the same occurred in our neighborhood when a man committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by hanging on a tree some days ago. No one guessed a married man living in a family, undertaking the responsibility of elderly parents, would take such a drastic step. This man has left his entire family in dire straits.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What causes some people to adopt such an aggressive mode? \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a most unnatural and undesirable act that people find hard to accept. But the harsh reality is that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has become one of the leading causes of death worldwide .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to World Health Organisation (WHO), every year almost one million people end their lives by committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is also increasing as society is developing. The ever increasing tendency to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among people has worried governments, social scholars and scientists. Numerous research studies have been carried out based on this in a bid to find out the factors that propel a person to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Medical scientists state that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is related to human psychology. When a person fails to cope with distress he/she chooses to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Social scientists claim social facts as reasons that propel a person to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Whatever may be the reason no society accepts \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as a normal thing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Considering the increasing number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases and its impact on family and society, various measures have been adopted by the government and humanitarian organizations to tackle this issue.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Initiated in 2003 by International Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention (ISAP) the World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day is now observed on September 10 in collaboration with WHO and other organizations dedicated to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to police reports, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases are increasing in our society. It has been placed under the category of social crime. So an awareness drive is a must to check this social crime.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the meantime, every individual should understand that life is the most precious gift of nature. We should understand its worth and learn to live a life with zeal.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 New Delhi, Sept. 9 -- Talking to someone about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will increase the chances that they will act on it true or false? False. The truth: When someone is in crisis or depressed, asking if he or she is thinking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can help. Giving a person an opportunity to open up and share their troubles can help alleviate their pain and open a path to solutions. This is just one of many \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention myths to debunk as we approach World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day on Sept. 10. 
\par \pard 
\par \pard 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a growing public health crisis. There were more than 38,000 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2010 in the United States, an average of 105 each day, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. There is one \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for every 25 attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  results in an estimated $34.6 billion in combined medical and work-loss costs.
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 "If we know anything about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , it's that many \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are preventable if we can get people through a crisis and intervene," says Timothy Lineberry, M.D., a Mayo Clinic psychiatrist and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention expert. "There are many steps we can take to tackle this public health crisis and debunking myths is certainly one of them.
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 "One of the most common myths about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is that talking about it won't help," says Robert Gebbia, executive director, American Foundation for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention. "We know that starting a conversation about depression or suicidal thoughts can actually encourage someone to open up and get the help they need."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kudos for dealing with reckless drivers
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kudos to St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert P. McCulloch for charging Mary Lott with involuntary manslaughter in the death of Missouri Department of Transportation worker Kenneth Hoierman ("Motorist is charged in death of highway worker," Dec. 9). This is a courageous step when it is next to impossible to convict drivers in a society in which many people still view fatal car crashes as accidents instead of the completely preventable tragedies that most are.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We need laws that make it easier for the judicial system to deal appropriately with all reckless drivers, not just those who have enough alcohol or drugs in their blood to get convicted, or those who kill highway workers. Dealing appropriately with reckless drivers should involve a combination of incarceration, fines and loss of driving privileges.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The latter, despite what most people still think, is not necessarily punishment, at least not in the conventional sense of the word. Many people do not need a car to get around, even in St. Louis. Those of us who love bicycles could show so many what a joy it is not to drive.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Reporting on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  should include prevention
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Regarding "People are wondering, who's next?" (Dec. 10): It is understandable that stories about individual deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  might be newsworthy to the local community and need to be covered. In response, the American Foundation for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention along with the Annenberg Public Policy Center and others have developed recommendations to encourage responsible, accurate and informative reporting about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These reports should explain the real causes of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , list \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  warning signs, include expert opinions and where someone can go for help if they are feeling depressed or suicidal. Reports should avoid describing the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  method or sensationalizing the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although the article delves deeply into the tragic deaths of these four teenage boys lost to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and discusses the fear of contagion, it misses a real opportunity to inform the public about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and ways to prevent it. For example, research shows that more than 90 percent of people who die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have an underlying (although not always diagnosed) psychiatric illness at the time of their death. We also know that the best way to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is education and vigorous treatment of depression and other mental illnesses that can lead to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Irony of Iraq milestones
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That war itself seems a natural part of human existence perhaps teaches us about the symmetry of justice, like an echo coming back. That sound reverberated as I listened to the Iraq Study Group pronounce repeatedly and emphatically the need for Iraq to institute "milestones." Ironically, it is the book "Milestones" that terrorism experts claim is the manifesto for Osama bin Laden's movement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Written by Egyptian writer and activist Sayyid Qutb during his political imprisonment in the late 1950s, "Milestones" argues almost mystically against modern materialism. The book was published in 1964, but was banned as treasonous. Two years later, Qutb was hanged by the Egyptian government when he refused to renounce his beliefs, declaring, "The time has come for a Muslim to give his head in order to proclaim the birth of the Islamic Movement."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For the neo-conservative and evangelical Americans who have fostered the predicted "clash of civilizations" - the West versus the Muslim world - the Iraq commission's ironic insistence on "milestones" may eerily signal that the West has come full circle to defeat.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 James Baker and the others nobly seek to avoid the abyss that lies beyond this, but the invasion and occupation of Iraq have not been only a military miscue, but also an act of injustice. The commission's 79 recommendations might correct the former, but something more will have to come around to right the latter.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Prevent wider conflagration
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Iraq Study Group's report is an effort to think of something, change course somehow, to prevent an American defeat in Iraq, but it's too late for that. The American military effort has reached the end of its ability to affect a situation that has descended into anarchy and civil war.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The ISG's critics argue that we cannot expect diplomacy with Iran and Syria to be of any help in winning the war. That is correct because the Bush war already is lost. The impelling imperative to communicate with Iraq's neighbors is to prevent our failed foreign policy from turning into a wider conflagration that envelops the entire region. That goal is achievable. Iran and Syria have a vested interest in seeing it achieved, and we have no time to waste in inaugurating such an effort.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At home, our best hope is diplomacy. Perhaps a senior bipartisan group of the new Democratic congressional leaders and what's left of the Republican leadership should meet with the president, again and again if necessary, to go to the mat in convincing him that he must get over himself and face the facts. The election is over, and the nation's best interest demands statesmanship.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We should declare a cease-fire in hopes that it will be reciprocated, begin withdrawal of U.S. combat troops and name a time for them to be gone from Iraq, not in 2008, but by summer or fall of next year.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The appeasing adults
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When will the media stop fawning over the consultation of James Baker by the Bush administration? The media now love the so-called "realists" of the first Bush administration, now anointed as the "adults." The release of the Iraq Study Group report shows what are "adult" positions: the appeasement of dictators and murderous terrorists by throwing whatever you can at the terrorists and their enablers if they will just go away (except, of course, that they do not go away, they keep coming back for more). That includes sacrificing our one true friend and the only liberal democracy in the entire Middle East, Israel. But Israel is not enough, so let's give them Lebanon, too. This is what passes for realism? Buying off terrorists who have proved that buying them off just emboldens them?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is what we should expect of Mr. Baker. In 1991, Mr. Baker and the first Bush administration demonstrated that realism means a willingness to throw your friends under the bus. During the Gulf War, Israel absorbed countless unprovoked Scud missile attacks from Iraq without any response. It did so at the urging of the United States and despite its best instincts that absorbing such attacks only leads to more. Israel was correct; the non-response led to more attacks. To repay Israel for its compliance with U.S. strategy, those solons Mr. Baker and then-President George H.W. Bush repaid Israel by forcing the Oslo Accords and Yassir Arafat on Israel, resulting in a decade and a half of unrelenting terrorism and the build-up of Hamas and Hezbollah, putting Israel's existence at even more risk.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Spare us the "realists." They embolden enemies and abandon friends every time.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mink: Finally right
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I never, ever have agreed with anything Eric Mink has written, and usually I find his views irritating. My hat is tipped to him, however, on his "Storm debris" (Dec. 6) column. He is correct in his assessment of the lameness of AmerenUE's excuses and the failure of its management. Somehow, area residents need to be given the option of buying their electric power from other suppliers. Service could not be worse, and the competition for customers only could make it better.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Stan Viglione | Ballwin
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Rash response
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is disturbing when so many people lose power. But more disturbing is the illogical thinking of some people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 People said AmerenUE should have trimmed trees more aggressively. But when huge limbs succumb to the immense weight of water, that "aggressive" tree-trimming would require almost all trees by power lines to be cut down.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 People are mad at Ameren about the Taum Sauk reservoir, but Ameren executives immediately accepted responsibility.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 People complain that Ameren's response to this storm was inadequate. But it is in Ameren's best interest to get everyone back online as soon as possible. Ameren was not getting money for a half million customers, and it paid thousands of linemen to travel hundreds of miles to work in icy-cold conditions to get the power back on. Ameren has everything to gain from a quick response. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I see no legitimate complaint against Ameren, although I see rash human thinking on the consumers' parts.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Offensive words
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Post-Dispatch devoted a large amount of space lately to the issue of whether or not the N-word is offensive. Editors and writers understand that while some people are comfortable using what historically has been an extremely offensive insult to African-Americans, the word is not appropriate for a headline or for everyday usage in a major metropolitan newspaper. The word offends many, and for good reason.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 So if the Post-Dispatch believes that words do carry meaning, especially those words that have been associated with the exploitation and abuse of a group of people, why did no one object to the headline "Pimp your house" (Dec. 9)? It's absurd and offensive to associate this word with what is for many people a spiritual and family-centered time of year. "Pimp" conjures only one meaning for anyone who doesn't use this word in everyday speech. The Post-Dispatch should not insult readers by using this word as if it no longer is offensive to women. It worries me to think of what the paper may resort to next to appear hip.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The number of young people committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has fallen to its lowest level in more than a decade.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Associate Health Minister Jim Anderton yesterday released the youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  figures for 2000, the fifth consecutive year that youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  numbers have fallen.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But he said there was no cause for celebration because 96 young people took their own lives that year. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "No statistics can hide the fact of the trauma of any \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," said Mr Anderton, who lost a daughter to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The 96 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of New Zealanders aged 15-24 in 2000 (a rate of 18.1 per 100,000 young people) compared with 120 in 1999 and 156 1995.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The figures are the lowest since 1986, when 91 young people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There was a large drop in the number of female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , from 37 in 1999 to 15 in 2000. There was little change in male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - 83 in 1999 and 81 in 2000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The number of young Maori committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  decreased from 43 in 1998 to 33 in 1999 and 28 in 2000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, the Ministry of Youth Affairs' youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention national co-ordinator, Debbie Edwards, said there had been a slight increase in 2000 over the previous year in the number of young Maori men committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Six young Pacific Islanders and five young Asians committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 New Zealand had the second-highest rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for males aged 15-24 and the fourth-highest rate for females among selected OECD countries. This is an improvement on 1999, when the country was highest in both categories.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Research from the Canterbury \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Project in Christchurch found about 90 per cent of people who committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or made \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts had one or more psychiatric disorders at the time.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The most common were depression, substance-use disorders (alcohol, cannabis and other drug abuse) and significant behavioural problems.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Anderton said the signs were good that the youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategy, released in 1998, was making a difference.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, officials were not certain what was causing the decline in the youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We could point to better economic conditions, we could point to more employment opportunities, we can point to some more optimism and hope among young people ... We can't be precisely certain that any of these events in themselves are the reason," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Improved mental health services, better access to health services and better understanding of the signs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  could be important factors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ms Edwards said the main sectors that dealt with young people had received training in recognising young people at risk, responding helpfully and referring them on to appropriate services.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said links with Maori culture and whanau were important in preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by young Maori.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Anderton said he had asked the ministry to look at areas where there seemed to be gaps in programmes. These included the post-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  period when family and friends of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims were themselves at greater risk of committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and the carers of those threatening \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , who also became at risk.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  THE death of any young person is a tragedy. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  compounds that tragedy. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , particularly youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , is one of the most critical and disturbing issues facing our society.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It is far more prevalent than most of us suspect. About 2400 people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year in Australia. Since 1990, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have exceeded road deaths and are the leading cause of injury-related death. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  crosses the boundaries of wealth, class, race, age and geography.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Yet, ironically, in this so-called enlightened age, we are reluctant to confront \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , especially among the young. Because it is so painful, so distressing, we choose instead to ignore it, to shy away from debate and discussion.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  We prefer to maintain a stoic silence rather than engage in informed debate. We shield behind the excuse that if we discuss \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , if we publicly seek answers, we will somehow encourage young people to consider \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as a solution.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  That is at best unproved and at worst socially irresponsible. The Advertiser does not report individual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unless it assesses they are in the public interest. But that does not mean we should ignore broader debate on this serious community problem.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  inevitably is a simplistic and futile call for help. A last resort. To a tormented young mind, death emerges as a safe haven.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  One estimate says 88 per cent of people who die from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  suffered mental disorder.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  As a society we are not educated to read the signs, to seek help, because \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  remains one of the last social taboos.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The secondary victims of youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the family and friends, are inevitably left heart-broken. They suffer an empty sense of hopelessness and guilt. They grapple almost alone with one central question: why?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It is time we confronted our fears and promoted rational, sensible and informed debate on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , particularly youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  To do otherwise is as illogical as it is irresponsible.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  People in need of urgent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  advice should ring Lifeline 131-114 or Assessment Crisis Intervention 131-465.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jan. 14--There were slightly fewer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Daviess County in 2012 than in 2011.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While the decline in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is good news, the members of the Owensboro coalition working to educate the public on how to help prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  say there is more work to be done.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There were 18 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2012, three fewer than in the county in 2011, Daviess County Coroner Jeff Jones said. Still, the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  last year was much higher than the number in the years before 2011 -- in 2010, there were 12 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the county, and there were 13 in 2009. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Officials say they don't know why the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  might have declined. In 2010, the last year for which statics were available, Daviess County had a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate of 16.5 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 individuals, said Mike Flaherty, chairman of the Owensboro Regional \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Coalition. The state average for the 2010 was 14.5 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 residents, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Flaherty said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is still considered taboo. But being able to talk about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , especially with people who appear to need help, is one of the best ways to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We still find there's a lot of stigma associated with suicidal behavior," Flaherty said. "We educate people to see it's more of a community health problem than anything."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There's no one reason people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Flaherty and Jones said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's a complex behavior. People try to make sense of this and want an answer. The best we (can do) is understand the risk factors. The more risk factors there are, and the more serious factors there are," the greater the person's risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Flaherty said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the American Association of Suicidology, depression is believed to be a factor in 60 percent of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The most significant factor is depression," Flaherty said -- but other types of mental illnesses also play a role; 90 percent of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims were people suffering from some type of mental health condition.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Another factor is substance abuse, Flaherty said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "One of the high risk factors is if someone had a drug or alcohol problem or their they're intoxicated at the time" they attempt to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Flaherty said. One-third of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are by people who are later determined to have been intoxicated at the time of the incident.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jan Ulrich, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention coordinator for the U.S. Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities, said previously there are multiple risk factors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although there are many reasons people consider or attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the best way to help prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is to not be afraid to discuss it with people you believe are at risk, Flaherty said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It has been shown if a suicidal person talks to anyone who guides them to help, that's extremely successful in (reducing) the risk" that the person will try to harm themselves. If you feel a person is strongly considering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , take them to the hospital, Flaherty said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's best to go with them and be there for them," Flaherty said. "Sometimes, just that sign of support is effective."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 People looking for help or needing someone to talk to about feelings of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  should call the National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Lifeline at (800) 273-TALK. Local help can be found by calling RiverValley Behavioral Health's crisis line at 684-9466.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 People affected by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can attend the National Survivors of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Day on Saturday at Oklahoma State University at Tulsa. Joan Benedict, one of the event's organizers, said 230 conferences are taking place simultaneously across the U.S. and overseas. This is Tulsa's second conference.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The network of conferences helps survivors connect with others who have been affected by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , to understand the powerful emotions they experience, Benedict said. Benedict, a regulatory specialist for a clinical research company in south Tulsa, became involved with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  awareness programs after her daughter, Chelsea, took her own life on June 12, 2007. When Benedict looked for support after her daughter's death, resources were sparse, she said. "This conference offers survivors the opportunity to come together as a community for support and healing," Benedict said. "To anyone who has lost someone to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , I would recommend attending the conference. It gives survivors the chance to share with others who walk in their shoes and in knowing that they are not alone." The Tulsa World published a three-day series on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  awareness and prevention Oct. 4-6. The World analyzed the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for the last five years. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have risen 12 percent since 2004. With 15 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 people, Oklahoma ranks 11th nationally in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , according to the American Foundation for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention. Wyoming is ranked first with 22.6 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 individuals. Meanwhile, Oklahoma's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is twice that of the homicide rate. In 2008, there were 578 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , compared with 249 homicides, according to preliminary data released by the state Medical Examiner's Office. The 2-to-1 ratio in Oklahoma is consistent with ratios in other states and the U.S. The conference at OSU-Tulsa, 700 N. Greenwood Ave., is free. Registration begins at 10 a.m., and lunch will be provided. Children 12 and younger should not attend. For more information go online to tulsaworld.com/afsp .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's never brought up at the family dinner table or even mentioned in polite conversation, but \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the 11th leading cause of death among Americans and New Mexico ranks fifth among states in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . It is the ninth leading cause of death for New Mexicans.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The New Mexico \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Coalition held a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention workshop at the Counseling Center in Alamogordo Wednesday. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sabrina Strong of NMSPC gave a presentation on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt survivors at the Behavioral Health Local Collaborative 12 monthly meeting.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Strong also conducted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention workshops at the Counseling Center between 1 p.m. and 6 p.m.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said she is a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt survivor.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I talked about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt survivors," Strong said. "They're a really unique population. There is not really a lot of support specifically for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt survivors."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said she thinks in the past there was an assumption that therapy would take care of it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It really doesn't take care of it," Strong said. "The term \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  survivor is not what people think it means. It actually means somebody who lost someone to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said she tries to help people with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention through her own experience with it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I struggle with how open I should be with people about my situation," Strong said. "The fact is I tried to kill myself and I survived my \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt. It's not good dinner conversation."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said she believes her story of survival helps people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "When I talk about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, I think it's really helpful to have somebody who tried it," Strong said. "Who is still here to tell the tale of how someone could've helped me. What it could've taken to help me."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Alamogordo, the Department of Public Safety is reporting an increase of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts from 2008. Between January 2009 and September 2009, officers have responded to 106 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  related calls ? 68 of the 106 calls were threats of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , 26 calls were attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and two calls were \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 2008, ADPS responded to ? 89 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  related calls, 48 of the 89 calls were threats, 25 were attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and eight calls were \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ADPS Director Sam Trujillo said the department has seen a drop from eight \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2008 to two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We're getting more reports of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  threats and attempts this year," Trujillo said. "Each case is examined on its own merits."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Strong said some things are helpful for some people while something else may be helpful for another individual.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "For some people, calling a crisis line is helpful," she said. "An attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is serious enough if the person intended not to be here anymore or not be here tomorrow."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Strong said a lot of times friends don't know how to help a person.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We use QPR which is like CPR," she said. "It stands for question, persuade and refer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The idea of the workshop is to give people the language to talk to someone who is struggling. People are not taught how to talk about these things like \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Strong said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is intertwined with the stigma of mental illness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We know that people who have suicidal crisis and get treatment," she said. "They're never suicidal again. The vast majority of people go on to live their lives and die a natural death."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Strong said in 90 percent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts, the person has a diagnosed mental health illness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The majority of it is depression," she said. "It also can be bipolar, anxiety disorders and schizophrenia. Alcohol and drug addiction also falls into it."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Misperceptions About Depression
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Fighting Misperceptions About Depression" [Seniors, October 22] perpetuates a myth about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among elderly adults: that the elderly commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at an alarming rate and that the rate is rising.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The facts are otherwise. "The elderly" do not commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at a notably higher rate than other age groups; only elderly males, especially white males, demonstrate an excessively high \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate, and they are a minority of the elderly population.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A clear majority of older people are women, and older women do not commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at greater rates than younger ones. Female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  remain at a more or less constant level from adolescence onward. Male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  peak during youth and old age; white males commit more than 70 percent of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; and white men account for nearly 80 percent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among the elderly. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is the exaggerated rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among older white males that skews the statistics to make it appear that "the elderly" have a high rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the United States 1980-1992," published in 1995 by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, traced the statistics on late-life \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by year from 1980 to 1992, the latest year for which final numbers were available. It concluded that the rate of elderly \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was up 9 percent over 12 years, but its numbers reveal an increase only in those aged 75 and older.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The 1992 rate is actually lower for those younger than 75; and they, men and women aged 65 to 75, constitute more than half of the elderly population.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I am a young person (age 30) with rheumatoid arthritis, and I found "Finding Pain's Sunny Side" [Health News, October 15] disturbing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pain for people with rheumatoid arthritis is a lot more than an annoyance. It can interfere with the ability to walk and climb stairs. I seek pain relief so I can do my job each day, which is caring for my son, stepson and a baby on the way. This is far from what was referred to as a " . . . preoccupation with pain relief." The ability to perform routine daily activities is as important a consideration as the possible side effects from pain medication.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Chronic illnesses need long-term treatments, but patients also need to feel better in the short term so we can get on with our lives and function on an everyday basis.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I applaud you for notifying parents with "Garage Door Openers a Threat to Children" (Cutting Edge, October 29]. But I wonder why I never see warnings about the danger to children when the large spring that controls the garage door as it closes breaks.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This has happened to us twice, and the first time, before my husband threaded a piece of retaining cable through it, the spring nearly struck him in the head. I've learned from several of my neighbors that their garage door springs have also broken.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If it is true that doctors believe early exposure to peanuts is a risk factor in the origination of peanut allergies ["Healthy Snack or Health Hazard?" Cover, October 1], I am alarmed that the numerous pediatricians and allergists we have seen over the last six years have only warned us to avoid cow's milk and honey before the age of 12 months.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Even after our first daughter was found to be severely allergic to peanuts, we have received no warnings from the health care community to avoid peanut-product exposure with our next child.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Doctors, if you have a theory on how to prevent this life-threatening allergy from forming, please share it with us.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Another Side of Meditation
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Meditating on the Bottom Line" [Health News, October 1] cites a study published in a medical journal that showed transcendental meditation to have reduced stress. And who conducted this study? Why, none other than a researcher from the Maharishi University of Management in Fairfield, Iowa. The objective reader must consider this a biased study.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The article is incorrect is describing TM as "extraordinary concentration" and meditation as simply a technique for stress reduction. The term "transcendental" is not accidental; it refers to the goal of transcending the rational mind and conscious awareness, which are seen as barriers to true reality.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 India records by far the largest number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the world, accounting for nearly a third of the global total and more than twice as many as China, which is second on the list. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 India also has the highest rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among young people - those aged 15 to 29 years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These were among the sobering facts revealed in a report released by the WHO, "Preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , A Global Imperative".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report noted that an estimated 8 lakh \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths occurred worldwide in 2012. It is the second leading cause of death in 15-29year-olds.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 India in 2012 recorded nearly 2.6 lakh \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 dwarfing China's 1.2 lakh.Its overall rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  (incidents per lakh population) was 12th at 20.9.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The worst countries on this parameter were North and South Korea, Guyana, Lithuania and Sri Lanka. Hungary , Japan, the Russian Federation and Belarus also had higher \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates than India. The Scandinavian countries, Sweden, Norway and Denmark -often perceived as societies with high \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates -had much lower rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In richer countries, three times as many men die of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as women, but in low and middle-income countries, the male-to-female ratio is much lower at 1.5 men to each woman. Globally , \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  account for 50% of all violent deaths in men and 71% in women.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In India, the ratio was about 1.6 with close to 1.6 lakh men committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2012 compared to just under 1 lakh women. In four countries in India's immediate neighbourhood -China, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan -women outnumbered men among \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .Only in Iraq and Indonesia was the proportion of women to men among those committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  higher than in these countries.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 India, despite its horrific statistics, has actually seen a decline in the tendency to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  since
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 2012, with the rate declining by 9.2% over this 12-year period. China, in the same period, saw its \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate drop by 59%. India is a clear exception to the global pattern of the 70+ age group having the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates. At 21.1 per lakh population, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among this age group are only about as common as among the entire population.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report revealed that ingestion of pesticide, hanging and firearms are among the most common methods of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  globally . It also listed various risk factors that contribute to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Risk factors associated with the health system and society at large include difficulties in accessing health care and in receiving the care needed, easy availability of the means for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , inappropriate media reporting that sensationalizes \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and increases the risk of "copycat" \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and stigma against people who seek help for suicidal behaviours, or for mental health and substance abuse problems. Risks linked to the community and relationships include war and disaster, stresses of acculturation (such as among indigenous peoples or displaced persons), discrimination, a sense of isolation, abuse, violence and conflictual relationships.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jan. 14--There were slightly fewer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Daviess County in 2012 than in 2011.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While the decline in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is good news, the members of the Owensboro coalition working to educate the public on how to help prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  say there is more work to be done.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There were 18 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2012, three fewer than in the county in 2011, Daviess County Coroner Jeff Jones said. Still, the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  last year was much higher than the number in the years before 2011 -- in 2010, there were 12 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the county, and there were 13 in 2009. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Officials say they don't know why the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  might have declined. In 2010, the last year for which statics were available, Daviess County had a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate of 16.5 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 individuals, said Mike Flaherty, chairman of the Owensboro Regional \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Coalition. The state average for the 2010 was 14.5 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 residents, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Flaherty said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is still considered taboo. But being able to talk about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , especially with people who appear to need help, is one of the best ways to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We still find there's a lot of stigma associated with suicidal behavior," Flaherty said. "We educate people to see it's more of a community health problem than anything."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There's no one reason people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Flaherty and Jones said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's a complex behavior. People try to make sense of this and want an answer. The best we (can do) is understand the risk factors. The more risk factors there are, and the more serious factors there are," the greater the person's risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Flaherty said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the American Association of Suicidology, depression is believed to be a factor in 60 percent of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The most significant factor is depression," Flaherty said -- but other types of mental illnesses also play a role; 90 percent of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims were people suffering from some type of mental health condition.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Another factor is substance abuse, Flaherty said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "One of the high risk factors is if someone had a drug or alcohol problem or their they're intoxicated at the time" they attempt to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Flaherty said. One-third of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are by people who are later determined to have been intoxicated at the time of the incident.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jan Ulrich, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention coordinator for the U.S. Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities, said previously there are multiple risk factors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although there are many reasons people consider or attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the best way to help prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is to not be afraid to discuss it with people you believe are at risk, Flaherty said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It has been shown if a suicidal person talks to anyone who guides them to help, that's extremely successful in (reducing) the risk" that the person will try to harm themselves. If you feel a person is strongly considering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , take them to the hospital, Flaherty said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's best to go with them and be there for them," Flaherty said. "Sometimes, just that sign of support is effective."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 People looking for help or needing someone to talk to about feelings of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  should call the National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Lifeline at (800) 273-TALK. Local help can be found by calling RiverValley Behavioral Health's crisis line at 684-9466.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 \'a6 SIR - I am sure that some effort is made to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  (Barry Taylor, Letters, September 14) but all the push in Parliament, the press, television (especially the BBC) is heavily concentrated on discussing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , especially assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and legalisation. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This is bound to be disturbing for those whose mental balance is fragile and who are already thinking of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The change in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Act in 1961 was done out of compassion for those who feel so badly about their lives and future that they attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, all we hear today is that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is legal, which is not likely to discourage anyone contemplating such an unnatural act.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There were 25 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the Bridgend area in the two years between 2007 and 2009 and many parents felt the media were glamorising \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and adding to the problem.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Eventually the police asked the media to stop reporting the deaths because they feared it was this that was encouraging the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . This shows that discussing the topic does affect some people to take their own lives.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 September 10, 2012, was the 10th anniversary of the institution of World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day. I may have missed it but as far as I can see there was no mention of this in any news outlet. Why does the media always report the latest request for assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and not the attempts to prevent it? The latest figures on the World Health Organisation website show 3,313 men and 932 women committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2009 in the UK.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Far from needing to encourage \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , we need to ask why is it that so many sick and disabled people are not clamouring for assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We need to ask whether a change in the law is needed which may make the majority of disabled people feel that their lives are not considered as valuable as the able-bodied. JANET SECLUNA THOMAS Dinas Powys

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  isn't a subject easily broached.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, the awkwardness and/or fear of discussing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  pales in comparison to the damage caused if the complex issue isn't brought to the forefront. Did you know: 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 30 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths occur each year on average in Halton
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Halton there are more than 420 hospitalizations each year from attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Halton Regional Police receives, on average, one call per day related to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Those are frightening statistics to be sure, however by bringing the issue of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  into the light, steps can be taken to help reduce those numbers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day is in September and Halton Region, along with the Halton \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Coalition, wants to raise awareness about the coalition's updated website that offers easy-to-access information and support for anyone either considering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or wanting to help a suicidal person.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The website is <a href="http://www.suicidepreventionhalton.ca" target="_blank">www.suicidepreventionhalton.ca .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 By working together and openly discussing the issue of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , it's hoped that, in time, the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Halton will significantly decline.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To ignore the issue certainly isn't the answer.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 People affected by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can attend the National Survivors of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Day on Saturday at Oklahoma State University at Tulsa. Joan Benedict, one of the event's organizers, said 230 conferences are taking place simultaneously across the U.S. and overseas. This is Tulsa's second conference.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The network of conferences helps survivors connect with others who have been affected by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , to understand the powerful emotions they experience, Benedict said. Benedict, a regulatory specialist for a clinical research company in south Tulsa, became involved with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  awareness programs after her daughter, Chelsea, took her own life on June 12, 2007. When Benedict looked for support after her daughter's death, resources were sparse, she said. "This conference offers survivors the opportunity to come together as a community for support and healing," Benedict said. "To anyone who has lost someone to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , I would recommend attending the conference. It gives survivors the chance to share with others who walk in their shoes and in knowing that they are not alone." The Tulsa World published a three-day series on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  awareness and prevention Oct. 4-6. The World analyzed the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for the last five years. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have risen 12 percent since 2004. With 15 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 people, Oklahoma ranks 11th nationally in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , according to the American Foundation for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention. Wyoming is ranked first with 22.6 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 individuals. Meanwhile, Oklahoma's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is twice that of the homicide rate. In 2008, there were 578 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , compared with 249 homicides, according to preliminary data released by the state Medical Examiner's Office. The 2-to-1 ratio in Oklahoma is consistent with ratios in other states and the U.S. The conference at OSU-Tulsa, 700 N. Greenwood Ave., is free. Registration begins at 10 a.m., and lunch will be provided. Children 12 and younger should not attend. For more information go online to tulsaworld.com/afsp .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The New Mexico \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Coalition held a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention workshop at the Counseling Center in Alamogordo Wednesday. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sabrina Strong of NMSPC gave a presentation on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt survivors at the Behavioral Health Local Collaborative 12 monthly meeting.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Strong also conducted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention workshops at the Counseling Center between 1 p.m. and 6 p.m.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said she is a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt survivor.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I talked about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt survivors," Strong said. "They're a really unique population. There is not really a lot of support specifically for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt survivors."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said she thinks in the past there was an assumption that therapy would take care of it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It really doesn't take care of it," Strong said. "The term \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  survivor is not what people think it means. It actually means somebody who lost someone to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said she tries to help people with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention through her own experience with it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I struggle with how open I should be with people about my situation," Strong said. "The fact is I tried to kill myself and I survived my \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt. It's not good dinner conversation."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said she believes her story of survival helps people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "When I talk about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, I think it's really helpful to have somebody who tried it," Strong said. "Who is still here to tell the tale of how someone could've helped me. What it could've taken to help me."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Alamogordo, the Department of Public Safety is reporting an increase of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts from 2008. Between January 2009 and September 2009, officers have responded to 106 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  related calls ? 68 of the 106 calls were threats of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , 26 calls were attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and two calls were \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 2008, ADPS responded to ? 89 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  related calls, 48 of the 89 calls were threats, 25 were attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and eight calls were \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ADPS Director Sam Trujillo said the department has seen a drop from eight \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2008 to two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We're getting more reports of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  threats and attempts this year," Trujillo said. "Each case is examined on its own merits."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Strong said some things are helpful for some people while something else may be helpful for another individual.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "For some people, calling a crisis line is helpful," she said. "An attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is serious enough if the person intended not to be here anymore or not be here tomorrow."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Strong said a lot of times friends don't know how to help a person.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We use QPR which is like CPR," she said. "It stands for question, persuade and refer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The idea of the workshop is to give people the language to talk to someone who is struggling. People are not taught how to talk about these things like \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Strong said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is intertwined with the stigma of mental illness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We know that people who have suicidal crisis and get treatment," she said. "They're never suicidal again. The vast majority of people go on to live their lives and die a natural death."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Strong said in 90 percent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts, the person has a diagnosed mental health illness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The majority of it is depression," she said. "It also can be bipolar, anxiety disorders and schizophrenia. Alcohol and drug addiction also falls into it."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Misperceptions About Depression
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Fighting Misperceptions About Depression" [Seniors, October 22] perpetuates a myth about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among elderly adults: that the elderly commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at an alarming rate and that the rate is rising.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The facts are otherwise. "The elderly" do not commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at a notably higher rate than other age groups; only elderly males, especially white males, demonstrate an excessively high \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate, and they are a minority of the elderly population.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A clear majority of older people are women, and older women do not commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at greater rates than younger ones. Female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  remain at a more or less constant level from adolescence onward. Male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  peak during youth and old age; white males commit more than 70 percent of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; and white men account for nearly 80 percent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among the elderly. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is the exaggerated rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among older white males that skews the statistics to make it appear that "the elderly" have a high rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the United States 1980-1992," published in 1995 by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, traced the statistics on late-life \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by year from 1980 to 1992, the latest year for which final numbers were available. It concluded that the rate of elderly \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was up 9 percent over 12 years, but its numbers reveal an increase only in those aged 75 and older.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The 1992 rate is actually lower for those younger than 75; and they, men and women aged 65 to 75, constitute more than half of the elderly population.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I am a young person (age 30) with rheumatoid arthritis, and I found "Finding Pain's Sunny Side" [Health News, October 15] disturbing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pain for people with rheumatoid arthritis is a lot more than an annoyance. It can interfere with the ability to walk and climb stairs. I seek pain relief so I can do my job each day, which is caring for my son, stepson and a baby on the way. This is far from what was referred to as a " . . . preoccupation with pain relief." The ability to perform routine daily activities is as important a consideration as the possible side effects from pain medication.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Chronic illnesses need long-term treatments, but patients also need to feel better in the short term so we can get on with our lives and function on an everyday basis.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I applaud you for notifying parents with "Garage Door Openers a Threat to Children" (Cutting Edge, October 29]. But I wonder why I never see warnings about the danger to children when the large spring that controls the garage door as it closes breaks.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This has happened to us twice, and the first time, before my husband threaded a piece of retaining cable through it, the spring nearly struck him in the head. I've learned from several of my neighbors that their garage door springs have also broken.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Some hardware stores carry kits to prevent this piece from flying off.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If it is true that doctors believe early exposure to peanuts is a risk factor in the origination of peanut allergies ["Healthy Snack or Health Hazard?" Cover, October 1], I am alarmed that the numerous pediatricians and allergists we have seen over the last six years have only warned us to avoid cow's milk and honey before the age of 12 months.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Even after our first daughter was found to be severely allergic to peanuts, we have received no warnings from the health care community to avoid peanut-product exposure with our next child.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Doctors, if you have a theory on how to prevent this life-threatening allergy from forming, please share it with us.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Another Side of Meditation
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Meditating on the Bottom Line" [Health News, October 1] cites a study published in a medical journal that showed transcendental meditation to have reduced stress. And who conducted this study? Why, none other than a researcher from the Maharishi University of Management in Fairfield, Iowa. The objective reader must consider this a biased study.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The article is incorrect is describing TM as "extraordinary concentration" and meditation as simply a technique for stress reduction. The term "transcendental" is not accidental; it refers to the goal of transcending the rational mind and conscious awareness, which are seen as barriers to true reality.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to a report daily 3 thousand people end their life. Every year more than one million people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . According to Global mortality rate a suicidal death occurs every 30 seconds. According to WHO, India has the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in the world. According to an estimate 1 lakh 20 thousand people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every year while 40 thousand attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and 40 percent of them are under the age of 30 years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Andhra Pradesh is 2nd in the country next to West Bengal. The 2010 crime report indicates that on an average, there are 43 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in AP every day, of which three \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occur in Cyberabad. Between April and June 2010, 52 students committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  due to academic pressure. An incident of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occurred every 3 minutes in India. Depression and frustration are the main causes of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 By paying attention towards such people the NGO Roshni works for the prevention of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  incidents.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 March 07--A $3,000 grant will enable a fledgling \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention organization to begin spreading its wings.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Monroe County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Coalition, formed last fall, will use the grant to fund a number of purchases and pay for training fees and initiatives -- all designed to help prevent youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the county. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The grant will allow us to do some of the things we want to do to get started," said Kristin Wolfe, the coalition's community liaison. "Our initial focus will be on making young people aware of all the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention agencies there are, and implementing programs into the schools and hospitals and community as a whole."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Wolfe said the money will buy \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention kits for young people, provide \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention teacher training and purchase \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention booklets for adults.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said the coalition will buy four Lifeline curriculum kits designed for middle and high school youth that discuss \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  warning signs and how to seek help for themselves or a friend at risk.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The kits will be used in the local schools by counselors and health class teachers," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Wolfe said some of the grant will be used to provide a one-day course in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention training for a person that will prepare that person to offer a two-hour training program in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention -- along with 140 booklets to be used by those taking the program.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This program teaches people how to recognize the warning signs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , directly ask about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and refer at-risk people for help," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Wolfe said the grant will also enable the coalition to buy 2,500 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention bookmarks that will be placed inside the textbooks of MCCSC students; and design a Monroe County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Coalition banner to be displayed at local events, such as the Out of Darkness Walk.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The grant was provided by the Indiana \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Coalition, Indiana Cares and Youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Progress.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Monroe County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Coalition, which operates as a formal subsidiary of the Monroe County Chapter of Mental Health of America, is made up of a people in the community who are concerned about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The group's goal is to address \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, intervention and post-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  support needs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Benefit planned
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There will be music, appetizers and dancing entertainment by the One Step Above Dance Company at an event to benefit the American Foundation for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention from 6 to 9 p.m. April 13 at the Bloomington Country Club. There will also be information about the Out of Darkness Walk this October. Tickets are $5 for high school and college students, $4 for children younger than high school age and $10 for adults. It's preferred that people order tickets before the event by calling 812-272-5407 or e-mailing burtmar0@bnths.nthls.com

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Text of report in English by South Korean newspaper Choson Ilbo website on 19 May
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The government will ban more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -related searches on portal sites and seek a revision of the relevant laws in an extra National Assembly session in June to stem a wave of online \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  pacts, the Ministry for Health, Welfare and Family Affairs and the National Police Agency said Monday. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That will make it more difficult to search \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -related websites or blogs, no matter how many \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -related search words - such as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , how to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , "jasal" (Korean word for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ), how to die, and joint \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - are typed in. The government will cooperate with large Internet portals including Naver, Daum, and SK Communications.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Authorities also plan to revise the laws on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention and electronic communications so that police can obtain the personal information of people who spread messages encouraging \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or offer counseling services to those who want to kill themselves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the NPA, 20 people had died in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  pacts between April 8 and May 9, with six others in serious conditions as a result of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts. Most allegedly met on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  websites.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ALMOST 3000 people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every day. The lives of family and friends are shattered every 30 seconds when a person takes their own life.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Today, too many people of all ages needlessly take their own lives and for every person who completes a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  20 or more may attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For family and friends affected by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  the emotional impact may last for many years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This was the significance in a statement released by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on Monday with focus of World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day this year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The statement emphasised that people of all ages commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and that actions to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  included in national responses should meet the needs of different age groups.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day is an opportunity for people worldwide to unite in commitment and action to ensure that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are prevented, the statement said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is a growing awareness of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as a major public health problem, even though there is a taboo in many societies against discussing it openly.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Worldwide, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates have increased by 60 per cent over the last 50 years, and the increase has been marked in developing countries.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates have fallen 15 per cent since the mid-1990s although hospitalisations for attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are continuing to rise.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A report released yesterday -- \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Trends: New Zealand 1983-2003 -- shows \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  steadily increased until the mid to late 1990s before beginning to fall. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Associate Health Minister Jim Anderton said the long-term trend was in the right direction but the nation could not be complacent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Any reduction in people taking their own lives is a good thing but when you see the increase in attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ... you know there is still much to be done."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hospitalisation rates for those who had attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  increased from 66.6 per 100,000 in the mid-1980s to 82.5% in 2002-2004.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report showed females were nearly twice as likely to be hospitalised for attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as males, with the highest rate of hospitalisations seen in 15 to 24-year-olds.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Anderton said a detailed action plan was expected from the Health Ministry next year on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention and a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  research network had also been set up.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report's three-year rolling averages show that in the mid-1980s the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate was 12 per 100,000 people rising to 16.7 in 1996-1998, then falling to 14.2 in the years 2001-2003. Three times as many men as women died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  between 2001 and 2003. Maori and those in poorer areas recorded higher \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 2003, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was the ninth most common cause of death in New Zealand accounting for 2% of deaths. For those aged 15-24, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was responsible for a quarter of all deaths, second only to accidents.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Information New Zealand director Merryn Statham said a 15% decrease in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates was "very encouraging". She also welcomed the analysis of long-term trends.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We are encouraging people not to look at year- by-year statisitics as very small increases can create quite large differences in rates which confuses people."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There was concern in February when the annual report on 2003 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  -- the latest figures available -- showed 51 more deaths than the 465 seen in 2002.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Canterbury \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Project director Dr Annette Beautrais said Australia and the UK had also seen falls in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates coupled with increased hospitalisations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said this could reflect better management of attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with greater awareness of the need for assessments for those who tried to take their own lives.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 P.E.I.'s Provincial \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Committee (PSPC) has designed a brochure to help family and friends in the aftermath of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The brochure, entitled Grief After \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 : A Pathway to Hope and Healing, offers information and reassurance to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  survivors and directs them to additional supports that may help them during this most difficult time.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a serious social issue that touches many Islanders. Each year, there are an average of 16 reported \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in this province. When the rippling effects of each one of those \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in close-knit Island communities are considered, the tragic and painful impact of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on P.E.I. is far-reaching. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The grieving process after \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is complicated. Research suggests that supports for family and friends left behind can lessen the impact of a completed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , reducing further distress or crisis for loved ones. With this in mind, the PSPC has designed this brochure, which is being distributed to funeral homes, emergency services, churches and health information agencies throughout the province.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Organizations are encouraged to display the brochures in an accessible location, perhaps with other resources, so that they can be available to survivors in their time of need.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mental health clinicians and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  survivors have reviewed the brochure to ensure that the information is both relevant and reliable. It was produced through funding support from the Royal Bank Employee Fund, McKennco Inc. and CMHA/P.E.I. division.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The PSPC is an interagency working group with representatives from various stakeholders and communities throughout the province. Its aim is to reduce the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate and to lessen the impact of completed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on P.E.I.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Everyone has a role to play in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, and all Islanders are encouraged to reach out with support to people in distress and those impacted by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For copies of the brochure or to learn more about local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention activities, contact the PSPC at 628-3669 or suicideprevention @cmha.pe.ca.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 THE number of young people committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fell to its lowest level in more than a decade in 2000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It was the fifth consecutive year to show a drop in youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  figures.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Associate Health Minister Jim Anderton, who released the latest youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  figures yesterday, said there was no cause for celebration. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 2000, 96 New Zealanders aged 15-24 (a rate of 18.1 per 100,000 young people) committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , down from 120 in 1999. In 1995, 156 young people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The 2000 figures are the lowest since 1986, when 91 young people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They show a big drop in the number of female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , from 37 in 1999 to 15 in 2000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There was little change in the male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate between 1999 (83 deaths) and 2000 (81 deaths).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The number of young Maori committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has decreased from 43 in 1998 to 33 in 1999 and 28 in 2000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Ministry of Youth Affairs' youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention national co-ordinator Debbie Edwards said there was a slight increase in the number of young Maori men committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2000 on the previous year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Six young Pacific people and five young Asians committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 New Zealand had the second-highest rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among young males aged 15-24 (highest in 1999) and the fourth-highest rate for females (highest in 1999) among selected OECD countries.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Research from the Canterbury \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Project in Christchurch found about 90 percent of people who committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or made \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts had one or more psychiatric disorders at the time.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The most common were depression, substance-use disorders (alcohol, cannabis and other drug abuse) and significant behavioural problems.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Anderton said the signs were good that the youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategy, released in 1998, was making a difference.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But officials were not sure what was causing the decline in the youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We could point to better economic conditions, we could point to more employment opportunities, we can point to some more optimism and hope among young people. . . We can't be certain that any of these events in themselves are the reason."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 SUICIDE\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has claimed 2164 Tasmanian lives since 1963, and this year between 50 and 100 more lives are likely to be added to that toll.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  More Tasmanians took their own lives between 1988 and 1997 than were killed on the roads.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  And the state's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate has historically been higher than national levels. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  University of Tasmania psychiatry professor Ken Kirkby said the high \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate compared with other rural and decentralised areas of Australia which suffered lack of services and isolation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Tough economic times also were linked to high \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates. Professor Kirkby said that during the "recession we had to have" in 1992 there were 97 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Tasmania -- the most for 20 years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The first long-term analysis of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Tasmania was released in Launceston yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Register Steering Committee's inaugural report also revealed a substantial drop in the number of gun-related \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  since the mid-1990s.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Professor Kirkby said this could be linked to the tougher gun laws that were introduced after the Port Arthur massacre.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But he said the decline was accompanied by an increase in the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by hanging and carbon monoxide poisoning.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The disturbing report contained some glimmers of hope.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  After a concerted national prevention campaign, the youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in Tasmania has fallen slightly over the past couple of years. And, for the first time since 1980, Tasmania's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate was below national levels in 1998 and 1999.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But Professor Kirkby said it was too early to tell whether the trends were changing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The report also revealed: *  Men account for 81% of Tasmanian \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and women 19%.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   *  Males aged 15-34 account for 34% of Tasmanian \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and men over 65 are also significantly over-represented in the statistics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   *  Women account for 54% of self-harm incidents.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   *  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  account for 10% of premature deaths in Tasmania.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   *  The fewest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was 45 in 1980, and there were 88 in 1999.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Register Steering Committee was set up by the State Government to monitor \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  trends and implement prevention initiatives.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Professor Kirkby said the report shed more light on changes and patterns of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and would help research into causes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Federal Government has allocated almost $40 million over four years for a national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Tasmania is heavily involved in the effort and, among other things, the State Government and University of Tasmania are working to deal with training and education in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention. *  Counselling services are available for anyone contemplating \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SOUTH BEND -- Aiming to bring awareness to the issue of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, local advocates are trying something a little different this year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As part of observances for National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Week, which runs through Sunday, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Center is holding a candlelight vigil for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  loss survivors to remember their family members and friends. It will begin at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at Howard Park, 219 S. St. Louis Blvd. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We want to bring \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  loss survivors together so they can feel a sense of community," Tracy Schneider, director of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Center, said. "We want people to feel like they're not alone. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the type of loss that some people aren't afraid to talk about while another group doesn't reach out and keeps the pain and loss inside."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The issue is gaining even more importance as the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  locally is on the rise. Schneider said there were 39 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in St. Joseph County in 2013, up from 27 the year before. A report issued in September last year by the Indiana Department of Health showed that for the years 2006 through 2010, St. Joseph County had 170 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , a rate of 12.8 per 100,000 population.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We want to bring awareness of the problem of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in our community," Schneider said. "It's very alarming first of all because we know \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be prevented if people have access to information and resources."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Schneider said it's particularly important to raise awareness of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention resources because studies have shown that for every \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  there are at least six survivors affected by the loss. Schneider said those survivors in turn are at increased risk for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  themselves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Schneider said her organization focuses on training people -- school employees and social workers, among others -- who may come into contact with at-risk individuals about the signs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and what they can do to help.  There are also general community education efforts provided to help people know what to do if they come into contact with someone who may be contemplating \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Wednesday's vigil will feature luminaria bags and candles as a way to honor lost family members and friends as well as to offer hope to others, Schneider said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This is the first time we've done a vigil, so I'm hoping we have a lot of people come out," she said. "I think it's a good way to bring people out. We'll be able to show support for each other, as well as provide information on what kind of services are available in the community."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When Hunter S. Thompson's ashes are shot into the air with fireworks this week to mark the six-month "anniversary" of his \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , media coverage will likely reverberate as loudly as the blast, romanticizing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  once again.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As a survivor of my 15-year-old son's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 1991 and board member of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Coalition of Colorado, I must remind people that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  isn't a noble, selfless act to be celebrated. It's the last desperate act of people in agonizing pain and confusion, people who were not able to find relief from an anguish that we can't comprehend. They're our parents, siblings, children and friends. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Tragically, each year in Colorado more than 700 people die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Colorado has the eighth highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in the country. It's the second leading cause of death for Coloradans ages 10 to 34. More people die from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than motor vehicle accidents in Colorado.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Chances are you are surprised by these statistics and wonder why you've never heard them before. It's because \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is shrouded in stigma and misinformation. Yes, it's uncomfortable and personal. Education and discussion around \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and depression prevent, not cause, the act.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 My children knew how to "stop, drop and roll" if their clothes were on fire. They knew to "buckle up," to "just say no" and to avoid "stranger danger." We had talked about drinking and driving, safe sex and about substance abuse; but it had never occurred to me to talk about what depression feels like. Beginning that conversation is prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is widely believed that more than 90 percent of people who kill themselves have a diagnosable mental illness, often depression or a bipolar condition. Sometimes the torment of one of these medical conditions drives a person to seek relief in drugs and/or alcohol, which, of course, worsens the condition. These are treatable conditions, from which it is possible to recover and enjoy life. It is vital that people understand that there is no shame in reaching out for help. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is preventable because mental illness is treatable. We must openly discuss mental illness and work to help people, including our children, identify life-threatening feelings of depression and despair.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We must encourage responsible, sensitive and balanced media reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . It is imperative that people know the startling facts about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Colorado. Each year in our state, 9,600 people attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . We consider tens of thousands more "survivors" of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  because they have been directly affected by the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of a friend or loved one. The grief, guilt and responsibility survivors feel is enormous.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I feel for Thompson's family and friends. I've been there.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 An average of two people die each day in Colorado from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Don't you think it's worthy of our attention and commitment to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention? That's why we work so fervently as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  survivors.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SOUTH BEND -- Aiming to bring awareness to the issue of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, local advocates are trying something a little different this year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As part of observances for National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Week, which runs through Sunday, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Center is holding a candlelight vigil for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  loss survivors to remember their family members and friends. It will begin at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at Howard Park, 219 S. St. Louis Blvd. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We want to bring \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  loss survivors together so they can feel a sense of community," Tracy Schneider, director of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Center, said. "We want people to feel like they're not alone. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the type of loss that some people aren't afraid to talk about while another group doesn't reach out and keeps the pain and loss inside."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The issue is gaining even more importance as the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  locally is on the rise. Schneider said there were 39 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in St. Joseph County in 2013, up from 27 the year before. A report issued in September last year by the Indiana Department of Health showed that for the years 2006 through 2010, St. Joseph County had 170 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , a rate of 12.8 per 100,000 population.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We want to bring awareness of the problem of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in our community," Schneider said. "It's very alarming first of all because we know \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be prevented if people have access to information and resources."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Schneider said it's particularly important to raise awareness of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention resources because studies have shown that for every \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  there are at least six survivors affected by the loss.

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 GENEVA, Sept. 5 -- A recent study by the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted that India reports of the highest number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases and that every 40 seconds a person commits \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  worldwide. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  according to report are reported in the South-East Asia Region and India accounted for the highest number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases when compared to other regions. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were mostly reported among youngsters and elderly. It was also observed that 75 percent of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were reported among the low and medium income countries. Some of the common \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  methods adopted were hanging and firearms and pesticide poisoning was of special concern in the rural agricultural areas.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report highlighted that as observed in many other countries restricting the access to the means of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can significantly reduce the cases. A comprehensive and dedicated plan of action like national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention in some countries must be established by the government to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Media should not sensationalize the content or the method of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  while follow up care must also be taken through phone calls and regular contact with doctors. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was recorded to be the second leading cause of death among 15-29 years old. Men are more prone to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than women.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Institute of Psychiatry (SCJI), Hyderabad, Dr. Darya Khan Leghari.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He was of the view that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a multi-dimensional disorder,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 which results from a complex interaction of biological, genetic,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 psychological and environmental factors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr. Khan maintained that in a country like Pakistan where growing
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 economic instability especially poverty has forced people to sell
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 their children and body organs, the reasons behind increasing rate of
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be understandable.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He was of the view that 50 percent of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are committed
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 due to `poverty and economic hardships'.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr. Khan said that some psychology experts also agreed that
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 majority of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are usually linked to economic difficulties
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 but there are other reasons behind committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and these
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 reasons can be depressive disorders, unemployment, domestic violence,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 parental separation, growing economic instability, child abuse,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 bullying, rising inflation and loss of social cohesion which force a
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 person to end his or her life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr. Khan said that Pakistan has witnessed a series of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 bombings in recent years. A \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bomber blows himself also causing
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 an immense destruction in the areas around it, he said and added that
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombing is also one of the reasons that enable a person to
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and end his life through such a sinful way.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr. Khan said that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has become a major health problem in
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pakistan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When a person attempts \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  his or her family usually tries to
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 cover this act and claims this incident as merely an accident thus it
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 is becoming difficult for Pakistan to compile national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 statistics, he added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said that the surveys and analysis revealed that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 has become more common in youth then in adult in many countries and
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pakistan is one of them. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates among youth are increasing due
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 to unemployment, pressure of work and studies, depression, anxiety and
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 increasing poverty, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to World Health Organisation (WHO) statistics, he said
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 that more than a million people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year worldwide,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 while the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt is successful 10-20 times.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr. Khan said that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and depression are linked to each
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 other as more than 80 percent of people who commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  suffering
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 from depression. He said studies suggest that lifetime risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 in people with depression was 15 percent, with alcoholism 7-15 percent
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 and with schizophrenia, 4-10 percent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, a substantial proportion of people who commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 die without having seen a mental health professional, he said and
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 added that detection, and referral and management of psychiatric
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 disorders in primary care was an important step in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  preventio Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Two out of 10 Seoul residents have considered committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , according to a recent survey.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a survey organized by the Seoul Metropolitan Government, 18.5 percent, or 185 out of 1,000 people, said they contemplated \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . At least seven of the respondents said they have tried to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the survey results showed. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The survey questioned 1,000 city residents, ages 15 to 65, and it was conducted to bring attention to increasing instances of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , city officials said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It asked how citizens perceived \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the reason behind their ideas to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and how those reasons actually affected them to take real action, officials added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It found that people who often felt depressed, or who regularly skip meals, were most prone to contemplating \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although about 80 percent of the respondents were negative towards \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , over 53 percent said they sympathized with the hardships of those who commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . More than 36 percent answered that committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is an individual's choice.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The most common reason for considering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was financial problems, followed by stress coming from the workplace, an unstable future and falling school grades, city officials said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Over 77 percent perceived \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as a serious national problem.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Close to 90 percent of respondents said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  could be prevented by if counseling or other treatments were provided.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 By 2005 instances of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had more than doubled from 1995, city officials said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It was also found that the No. 1 cause of death among those in their 20's and 30's was \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , officials said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The city government has been operating a hotline and a website designed solely to provide consultations 24 hours a day. The hotline is (02)1577-0199 ,or visit their website at www.\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .or.kr

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 More people kill themselves in the central Vancouver Island area than the number of people who die in motor vehicle accidents and homicides combined, says a spokeswoman for the Central Vancouver Island Crisis Society.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Between 1997 and 2004, 215 people died of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the central Island," said Lyndsay Wells, the society's community education program director.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 During the same period in the mid-Island, there were 137 fatalities from car accidents and 15 homicides, Wells said, citing statistics from the B.C. Coroners office. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Wells said that the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  could be greater than what the coroner reported because some of the single-vehicle fatal accidents could have been \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I find this interesting because I would have thought that the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  would have been lower than the number of MVAs," she said. "The deaths by car accidents and homicides are always reported but at least 25% of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are not reported as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Canada, approximately 4,000 people kill themselves annually and according to the B.C. Coroners Service, 525 British Columbians died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2004, the last year statistics are available.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To create awareness about the prevalence of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the society has a big event planned for Sunday at Maffeo-Sutton Park, the day before World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It will be our second memorial vigil for anybody in the community who has lost somebody to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," Wells said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The vigil takes place between 7:30 p.m. and 9 p.m.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It is a really moving event," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For the vigil, the society is putting together a retrospective multi-media presentation and they are asking people for photographs of loved ones who died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Anyone who has a photograph they would like to contribute to the presentation can do so by e-mailing it to heather@cvics.ca
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The vigil is an important step in the healing process for those who have lost a loved one to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , said Wells.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Losing someone to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  initiates a very complicated grieving process.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There can be an awful lot of guilt or blame attached."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Events like the vigil bring together people who can talk about their feelings after having suffered such a devastating loss.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Talking about their feelings is very important because someone who has lost someone to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is much more likely to take their own life, she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "People who have lost someone to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are nine times more likely to take their own lives than those who have not lost someone to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On Monday, World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, the crisis society is holding an intensive three-hour \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  awareness program.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It alerts people to the warning signs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and gives them skills so they can address the issue of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to the individuals they are worried about," said Wells, adding it will also point people in direction of services for those who are concerned a loved one may be contemplating taking their own life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To register for the awareness program, people are urged to call the society's office at 250-753-2495.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There are still spots available but it usually fills up pretty fast," said Wells.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When Hunter S. Thompson's ashes are shot into the air with fireworks this week to mark the six-month "anniversary" of his \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , media coverage will likely reverberate as loudly as the blast, romanticizing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  once again.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As a survivor of my 15-year-old son's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 1991 and board member of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Coalition of Colorado, I must remind people that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  isn't a noble, selfless act to be celebrated. It's the last desperate act of people in agonizing pain and confusion, people who were not able to find relief from an anguish that we can't comprehend. They're our parents, siblings, children and friends. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Tragically, each year in Colorado more than 700 people die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Colorado has the eighth highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in the country. It's the second leading cause of death for Coloradans ages 10 to 34. More people die from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than motor vehicle accidents in Colorado.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Chances are you are surprised by these statistics and wonder why you've never heard them before. It's because \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is shrouded in stigma and misinformation. Yes, it's uncomfortable and personal. Education and discussion around \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and depression prevent, not cause, the act.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 My children knew how to "stop, drop and roll" if their clothes were on fire. They knew to "buckle up," to "just say no" and to avoid "stranger danger." We had talked about drinking and driving, safe sex and about substance abuse; but it had never occurred to me to talk about what depression feels like. Beginning that conversation is prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is widely believed that more than 90 percent of people who kill themselves have a diagnosable mental illness, often depression or a bipolar condition. Sometimes the torment of one of these medical conditions drives a person to seek relief in drugs and/or alcohol, which, of course, worsens the condition. These are treatable conditions, from which it is possible to recover and enjoy life. It is vital that people understand that there is no shame in reaching out for help. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is preventable because mental illness is treatable. We must openly discuss mental illness and work to help people, including our children, identify life-threatening feelings of depression and despair.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We must encourage responsible, sensitive and balanced media reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . It is imperative that people know the startling facts about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Colorado. Each year in our state, 9,600 people attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . We consider tens of thousands more "survivors" of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  because they have been directly affected by the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of a friend or loved one. The grief, guilt and responsibility survivors feel is enormous.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I feel for Thompson's family and friends. I've been there.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 An average of two people die each day in Colorado from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Don't you think it's worthy of our attention and commitment to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention? That's why we work so fervently as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  survivors.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Reducing New Zealand's high \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate depends on developing prevention strategies that reflect the needs and circumstances of the people living here, says a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  researcher.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Canterbury \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Project has collated data on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and serious \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts in the region since 1981.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Principal researcher Annette Beautrais told delegates at a Canterbury Community Council on Alcohol and other Drugs conference in Christchurch that a better understanding of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  risk factors should lead to the development of better prevention strategies. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Her research suggested it was important not to uplift successful overseas programmes, but to develop ones specific to New Zealand.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For example, choice of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  method reflected culture, country, and availability. Hanging was a commonly used method in New Zealand, whereas shooting was common in the United States.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Therefore, restricting access to firearms might have a significant impact on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in the United States, but not in New Zealand.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Canterbury \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Project has studied about 500 people who have either died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or made serious attempts on their lives.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Attempts by about 130 young people were separately analysed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Data showed the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate of young New Zealand males to be among the highest in the developed world, second only to Finland, ''and the rate has quadrupled in the last 20 years''.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Publicity about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  often gave the impression that it was common among young people and that the reasons for it were unknown. Neither was true, Ms Beautrais said, and the risk factors were multiple.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The research showed:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  One in four young people had suicidal thoughts, ''but most do not act on them''.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  One in 20 attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  without inflicting serious harm.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  One in 1000 attempts are serious and result in admission to hospital.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 About one in 4000 young people die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is not common among young people,'' Ms Beautrais told delegates. ''In fact, most so-called youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  -- more than 60 per cent -- occur in the 20-to-24 age group.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Age itself could be seen as a risk factor. Statistically, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  seldom occurred among teenagers, and was ''rare'' among the under-15s.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''Youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  represent only a third of the total number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ,'' Ms Beautrais said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''Most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  involve people over 25, and the most common group is adult males aged 25 to 50.''

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  LIFE assurers are paying out 10 times more on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than they were 12 years ago, raising fears that the way policies are written may be encouraging people to kill themselves to ease their dependants' financial difficulties.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  According to a report published today in Money Week, the payouts on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -related claims increased from pounds 4.3m in 1979 to pounds 44.6m in 1991. The number of claims rose from 908 to 2,218. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Contrary to popular myth, most life assurers pay out on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  partly because of pressure from building societies, which want to ensure that their endowment- linked loans are secure, even in cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The report is based on confidential statistics compiled by the Association of British Insurers. Of 102 life offices that responded, only 40 had \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  exclusion clauses, preventing automatic payouts on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  And of these 40, most only outlawed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  claims for the first 12 or 13 months of the policy. Thereafter the heirs of people who commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can still claim.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Life offices with exclusion clauses paid out pounds 2.6m on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 1991, compared with pounds 42.1m paid out by life offices with no exclusion clauses.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  According to Tony McMahon, features editor of Money Week: ''It would appear that people are killing themselves because of the absence of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  clauses.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  ''It does look like they are targeting life assurance offices where there is no \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  clause.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Many large insurers have no \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  clauses, including Royal Life and Equity & Law. Royal Life has launched an internal inquiry into claims on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  It fears economic hardship is fuelling the increase.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  According to Icki Iqbal, chief actuary of Royal Life: ''We believe is it recession-related. As a life office specialising in mortgage products, we will be interested to know if the strains of over-borrowing drive some to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The ABI asked life offices for details of their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  exposure in July last year. Insurers with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  clauses saw claims grow from 60 worth pounds 147,000 in 1979 to 196 worth pounds 2.6m in 1991. Insurers without \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  clauses saw claims grow from 846 worth pounds 4.1m to 2,022 worth pounds 42.1m.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The figures may understate the true size of the phenomenon. Because of the taboo over \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  some coroners' courts are reluctant to bring in a verdict of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Some deaths judged ''accidental'' or given open verdicts may in fact be \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a global issue and a leading cause of death in the world claiming lives of around one million people every year.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a multidimensional disorder, which results from a complex interaction of biological, genetic, psychological and environmental factors, said eminent psychiatric of Sir Cowasjee Jehangir (S.C.J.) Institute of Psychiatry,  Hyderabad Dr. Darya Khan Laghari, Thursday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr. Darya Khan Laghari, said that some psychology experts also agree with the fact that majority of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are usually linked to economic difficulties but there are  other reasons behind committing of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and these reasons can be depressive disorders, unemployment, domestic violence, parental separation, growing economic instability, child abuse, bullying, rising inflation and loss of social cohesion which force a person to end his or her life or release them from the pain they are suffering from. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Talking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombing he said a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bomber blows himself, also causing an immense and fatal destruction in the areas around it. He added that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombing is also one of the ways  that enable a person to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and end his life through such a sinful way.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said that these are some instances, which appear through media as many cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Pakistan are not reported.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In recent years, psychiatrist  said that Pakistan has witnessed a drastic increase in the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but the basic thing is that it does not collect national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  statistics nor report them to WHO (World Health Organization) so due to that it has become very difficult to compile  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  statistics and thus made the planning of prevention programmes, almost impossible.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said that the facts showed  that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has not only become a health problem in Pakistan, but that there are no official statistics and national rates are unknown. The other reason to support this aspect is also that when a person attempts \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  his or her family usually tries to
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 cover this act and claims this incident as merely an incident thus it is becoming difficult for Pakistan to compile national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  statistics and report them to the WHO, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said the  rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is consistently higher in men than women and men outnumber women by 2:1 and there are more single then married men involved.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said that the surveys and analysis showed that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0   has become more common in youth than in adult in many countries and Pakistan is one of them. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates among youth are increasing due to unemployment, pressure of work and studies, depression, anxiety and increasing poverty, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr. Darya Khan Laghari further elaborated that Pakistan's population is 162 million and it is ranked as the 6th most populous country in the world. The official unemployment stands at 12 percent of the eligible workforce and health spending is only 0.7 percent of the national annual budget, he said and added that Pakistan is also a Muslim country and according to Islam \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is considered forbidden and prohibited.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Islam is the only religion that has a clear scriptural ban on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , so, it has an independent effect on lowering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates but still many people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  everyday in Pakistan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to World Health Organisation (WHO) statistics, he said that more than a million people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year worldwide, while the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt is successful 1020 times.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and depression are linked to each other as more than 80 percent of people who commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  suffer from depression. He said studies suggest that lifetime risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in people with depression was 15 percent, with alcoholism 715 percent and with schizophrenia, 410 percent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, a substantial proportion of people  commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  die without having seen a mental health professional, he said and added that detection,  referral and management of psychiatric disorders in primary care was an important step in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  City of Yonkers, The State of New York has issued the following news release:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Yonkers Mayor Mike Spano today announced that the City Hall Clock Tower will be lit purple and turquoise to symbolize the national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention ribbon in honor or World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day on Wednesday, September 10. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Week is the Monday through Sunday surrounding World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a very serious public health issue that is often difficult to understand," said Mayor Mike Spano. "I encourage you to talk to your families and children about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention and use the resources available during \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Week to educate yourselves further."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This year's theme is "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention: One World Connected" and will focus on raising awareness that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a major preventable cause of premature death on a global scale. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  claims approximately 1 million lives a year, resulting in one death by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every 40 seconds.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the American Association of Suicidology, risk factors to self-harm include mental illness, substance abuse, prior attempts at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , recent loss of loved ones, and unemployment. Protective factors that act as a buffer against \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and suicidal behaviors can be social connectedness, and a supportive family and friends.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mayor Spano added, "On World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day today I want to call Yonkers residents to action. Learn about the warning signs and risk factors for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and act accordingly if you feel someone you know and love is struggling with suicidal thoughts."

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a major public health issue across the world. It is the cause of 800,000 premature deaths globally, according to latest statistics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the 1990s, China had one of the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates (23.2 per 100,000 people). An estimated 250,000 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were reported every year in the 1990s, accounting for about a quarter of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the world. In fact, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was the fifth leading cause of deaths in China. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Besides, more women than men committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in China during the period, which was drastically different from the about 3:1 male-female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ratio in Western countries. Also, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in China was substantially higher in rural areas than in cities, with older adults more prone to committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Perhaps the imbalance in medical and social welfare between urban and rural areas in China put older residents in the countryside at greater risk of committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Although mental illness plays a relatively low role in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in China, psychiatric help and other related support are far from sufficient. And the low social status of Chinese women and the limited opportunities they have to fulfill their dreams have been blamed for the relatively high rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among women, especially in rural regions.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The good news is that the overall \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in China has declined significantly because of the country's fast-paced economic development. The estimated mean national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate now is 9.8 per 100,000 people, nearly 60 percent lower than in the 1990s. Urbanization and economic growth in the past decade have created more education and employment opportunities for everyone, especially those women in rural areas, and reduced gender inequality. Controls on the sale of pesticides, which many rural people used to drink to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and the improvement in healthcare services have also contributed to the decline in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 China's experience seems to be at odds with French sociologist Emile Durkheim's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  theory, which says that economic growth epitomized by industrialization, urbanization and modernization usually leads to higher level of social anomie and lower level of social integration as a result of popularized individualism and egoism, and subsequently increases the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate. In China, however, these factors can work as protective shield against \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 An increasing number of rural women are migrating to cities in search of better livelihood. Relocation from rural to urban areas provides women with an escape route - from familiar obligations and undesired marriage proposals - and employment provides them with financial means to pursue a career and/or find their Mr Right. In the past, Chinese women were often trapped in a routine life in which they rarely realized their personal goals. But today, women in China have more opportunities for better education and employment. The traditional tension within Chinese families and the associated social pressures have also lessened, and divorce has become an acceptable way of dealing with family problems and conflicts. Gender discrimination in employment is still a major social problem, which is visible in hiring, dismissals and wage differences, denial of certain social welfare benefits, sexual harassment and fines for violation of family planning regulations. But the situation is better than it was a decade ago.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Monday (Sept. 10) marked the 10th anniversary of World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, a day when people are encouraged to discuss solutions to what is becoming a prevalent mental-health issue among our young people. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to Children's Mental Health Ontario (CMHO), \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the second leading cause of death among 10-24 year olds in Canada.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Untreated mental illness - depression, in particular - is the leading risk factor for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For every \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  completion, there are thousands more young people having thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempting it, according to the CMHO.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One recent study found one in 10 students in Grades 7-12 reported they had seriously considered \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and about three per cent reported attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Among Aboriginal youth, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is estimated to occur at rates five times higher than non-Aboriginal youth.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In keeping with the theme of this year's World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day in Ontario, "All Together - Promoting Hope and Resiliency," the CMHO joined with the Canadian Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention to encourage communities across the province to get involved by showing their support for people affected by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and promoting a collaborative approach to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While support can be expressed many ways, the gift of non-judgmental support is of utmost importance.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Shame is one of the most challenging and prominent feelings around \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The stigma associated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  often prevents those suffering from getting help.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We need to be open and we need to be educated," said Gordon Floyd, president and CEO of CMHO. "Let's remove the stigma associated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and start talking about it. "One in five children and youth has a mental-health issue severe enough to seriously affect their daily functioning at home, school or within the community.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Early intervention remains critical to young people having the best possible chance at succeeding in all aspects of their life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Community Council of Hamilton (www.spcch.org) offers resources for people struggling with thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . In addition to reaching 24-hour assistance by calling 911, those in crisis can call the Crisis Outreach and Support Team at 905-972-8338 or visit the organization's web site at www.coasthamilton.ca.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Other area \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention resources include the Salvation Army \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Crisis Line, at 905-522-1477 and Telecare Burlington at 905-681-1488 or www.telecareburlington.com.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ranked as the ninth leading cause of death in Canada in 2009, but among young people aged 15 to 34 it was the second leading cause, preceded only by accidents. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A Statistics Canada report shows that in the year 2009 there were roughly 238,000 deaths in Canada and some 3,890 of them were attributed to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A total of 202 teenagers aged 15 to 19 committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2009. While over time the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate within this group has remained relatively stable, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are now responsible for a greater percentage of teenage deaths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 2009, the study reveals nearly one-quarter (23 per cent) of all deaths among 15- to 19-year-olds were due to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - more than double the proportion of 9 per cent in 1974.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This difference is primarily explained by decreases in accidental deaths in this age group during the same time period.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was the second leading cause of death among teens in 2009, the majority of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occurred in the 40 to 59 age group. About 45 per cent of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occurred in this age group, compared with 35 per cent in those aged 15 to 39, and 19 per cent in those aged 60 and older.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate for men in Canada is more than three times higher than the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate for women. During 2009, 2,989 men committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , representing a rate of 17.9 per 100,000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Among women, there were 901 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths, representing a rate of 5.3 per 100,000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although men are more likely to die from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , women are three to four times more likely to attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Furthermore, females are hospitalized for attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  1.5 times more often than males.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In general, married people were the least likely to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  compared with single, widowed or divorced individuals. For men, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate was the highest among single men, while for women, widows had the highest rate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hanging has been the most common method of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  since 1992, but it is used less often at older ages. Over the 10-year period ending in 2009, an average of 55 per cent of individuals aged 15 to 39 died as a result of hanging, compared with 30 per cent of those aged 60 or older.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  involving a firearm, on the other hand, were more common at older ages. About 12 per cent of people aged 15 to 39 used a firearm, compared with 26 per cent of those aged 60 and older.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Historically, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates were fairly stable in the 1950s, after which they rose steadily from the 1960s through the early 1980s.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The rate peaked at 15.1 deaths per 100,000 in 1983; by 2009, it had dropped to 10.7.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  missions are not a recent phenomenon.  Some researchers trace the trend back to the Russian anarchists at the start of the 20th century; others go back to ancient history.  Yet there is no overarching explanation as to why groups and individuals resort to this form of political violence.  As Diego Gambetta, the editor of \b0 \i \ul0 Making Sense of \cf17 \b \i \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i \ul0  Missions\b0 \i0 \ul0  points out, the characteristics, motives and aims of organisers and attackers are so diverse that it makes it hard to identify one single cause.  This book of essays demonstrates the diversity by dealing with groups ranging from the Japanese Kamikaze and the Tamil Tigers to al-Qaida, Hamas, Hizbullah, and other Lebanese and Palestinian organisations. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Contrary to those who see \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  missions as some sort of dark ritual, or those who dismiss them as irrationally criminal actions, the authors show us that they are often the result of cold calculation.  For one thing, they are more effective than other forms of political violence.  According to one contributor, Luca Ricolfi, writing on "Palestinians 1981-2003", \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attacks had "10 to 15 times the destructive power of ordinary terrorist attacks".  Yet they are not only meant to be instrumental actions, but symbolic too.  The Japanese army and the Tamil Tigers aimed at achieving military victory, while 9/11 could be seen as more symbolic than instrumental.  Hamas and Islamic Jihad have had many different aims: fighting military occupation, showing an extreme level of commitment to their cause, and destroying the peace process in order to regain place at the centre of Palestinian politics.
\par \b0 \i \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Making Sense of \cf17 \b \i \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i \ul0  Missions\b0 \i0 \ul0  is an enlightening collection of essays.  It makes us aware that carrying out a suicidal mission is rarely the result of the perpetrator being personally suicidal, a fact Nadia Tysir Dabbagh's \b0 \i \ul0 \cf17 \b \i \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i \ul0  in Palestine\b0 \i0 \ul0  crystallises.  Dabbagh is a British Palestinian doctor who in 1997 undertook fieldwork in Ramallah for a PhD on what was seen then as an alarming "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  phenomenon" in Palestinian society.  Dabbagh explains that the number of cases was not particularly high, nor were the causes bizarre or unusual.  Furthermore Palestinian society, like most Arab and Islamic societies, regards \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as shameful and contrary to the dictates of religion.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is for these reasons that Palestinians, particularly organisers of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombing, insist on making a distinction between conventional \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombing: the first is a reprehensible private act, while the second is a revered form of martyrdom.  Dabbagh shows that suicidal people in Palestine tend to do what suicidal people do everywhere: that is, kill themselves by taking an overdose, not blow themselves up on the streets of Tel Aviv.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Situating cases of suicidal people, at least those of whom she managed to interview, within the larger context of Palestinian culture and society, Dabbagh's study leads us to conclude that poverty, social marginalisation and oppression could compel people to self-killing, but not self-sacrifice.
\par \b0 \i \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Making Sense of \cf17 \b \i \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i \ul0  Missions\b0 \i0 \ul0  and \b0 \i \ul0 \cf17 \b \i \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i \ul0  in Palestine\b0 \i0 \ul0  are academic books; those who are not fond of tables, diagrams and statistics will start reading \b0 \i \ul0 The Road to Martyrs' Square\b0 \i0 \ul0  with a great sense of relief.  However, the relief does not last long.  This book is largely a personal record of its two authors who spent five years in the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem.  Here they met a good number of Hamas supporters and gathered a huge amount of underground media: videotapes, audiocassettes, cards, photographs of graffiti etc.  The authors describe it as "part memoir, part travelogue, part journey into the underground media of the intifada [and] part exploration of the links between martyrdom and 'identity politics'".  Thus they take on the risk of incoherence, a risk that, sadly, the narrative rarely survives.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One moment we find them waiting to interview Sheikh Yasin, spiritual leader of Hamas later assassinated by the Israelis, and another they are house-hunting in Jerusalem and all in a language which is often either raw or random.  Describing a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bomber, they say: "He has curly brown hair and brown eyes, jerks his eyebrows up and down like Groucho Marx when he talks -- resembles Woody Allen, if Woody Allen could look so happy." Apparently some people cannot help being jolly even when talking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombing.  Not that such a seemingly intimate appraisal of the "world of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bomber" adds a jot to our understanding of what truly motivates them.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  statistics: Young men under the age of 30, who were unemployed and suffered from undiagnosed depression were the most likely group to die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , an eight-year study of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Co Kildare has shown.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The research, carried out by Dr Cliona McGovern and Prof Denis Cusack of the Division of Legal Medicine, University College Dublin, found 84 per cent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the county between 1995 and 2002 were male. Of 109 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  during this period, 32 occurred in men aged between 20 and 30. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The youngest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was in a boy aged 11. Some 23 deaths occurred in people aged 60 and over. The annual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate for the period under study was 10 per 100,000 population. This compares with an official Central Statistics Office (CSO) national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate of 11.5 per 100,000 people in 2002.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A study of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Kildare, 1995-2002, published in the Journal of Clinical Forensic Medicine points to a discrepancy between the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  figures recorded by coroners and those provided by the CSO. Form 104 is used by the CSO to supplement a coroner's certificate. It is completed by a Garda Inspector who is asked: "Please state, in your opinion, whether the death was accidental; suicidal; homicidal; undetermined."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to McGovern and Cusack, the discrepancy arises because the phrasing "in your opinion" creates difficulties. They also note some coroners may be reluctant to bring in a verdict of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . "The reluctance of some coroners to return a verdict of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can have social, historical or religious reasons.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The issue of some coroners either not returning a verdict of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  where necessary or the death not being recorded as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on Form 104 is a matter of grave concern," Prof Cusack, who is coroner for Co Kildare, told The Irish Times yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When the method of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was examined, hanging, at 49 per cent of cases, was the most common. Shooting, drowning and carbon monoxide poisoning were the next most common methods. Although \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by starvation is extremely rare, 4 per cent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the study were by this method. A single event, involving \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by starvation among four members of the same family, accounted for the high number.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While the unemployed were the single most likely occupational group to die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , two doctors featured in the study. Both died, it is understood, by sophisticated methods of self-medication (poisoning). Some 52 per cent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occurred on Saturday, Sunday and Monday. The months of May, June and July accounted for 32 per cent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . "This is contrary to what we expected to find, that of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occurring more frequently in the darker winter months," the authors state.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In an analysis, they examined the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  notes left by 35 per cent of victims. They frequently referred to feelings of depression or sadness. Most indicated the victim's decision was not a spur of the moment one.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "What this indicates is that there is a proportion of people who suffer from chronic depression without receiving any help or treatment for it," they add. "What was also worrying is the distancing and isolation that a lot of young men felt. In some cases they spoke of being a burden to their families as they could not get a job or they were 'useless'."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 More Australians die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than in road accidents.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Australian Bureau of Statistics yesterday released data showing that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  continues to be the prime killer of young people. In 2001, the bureau counted 2454 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  nationally. The road toll for the same period was 1736. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Patrick McGorry, professor of psychiatry at Melbourne University, called on governments to redouble the effort on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention as they did to tackle the road toll.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a very important public health matter," Dr McGorry said. "It's not just an adolescent issue, it's a young adult issue."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  remains disturbingly high, the Bureau of Statistics' study shows the group with the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates is those aged 25 to 34. But people aged from 25 to 44 accounted for 47 per cent of total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths in 2001.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by people aged 15 to 24 accounted for 339 deaths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But the prevalence of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has decreased since the highest number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - 2720 - was recorded in 1997.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The overall figure in 2001, however, was slightly higher than in the previous year, when 2363 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were registered.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In counting a death as a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the bureau takes a cautious approach. Possible \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - those cases in which the coroner makes an "open" finding - are excluded from the analysis.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Chin Choy, a health statistician at the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, said he believed the increase was not particularly significant because the 2001 figure included some deaths that occurred in the previous year. "I am hopeful the trend of decline will continue," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The bureau's data shows that male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  outnumber female deaths by about four to one.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Heather Hales, a mother of three, has painful first-hand knowledge of the devastation of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on a family. Her daughter Penny, 23, who suffered from bouts of depression, killed herself while travelling overseas in December 2001.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Penny was a delightful girl who had a wide circle of friends," said Mrs Hales. "There were no warning signs that she was going to kill herself." In a letter Penny left for her parents, she wrote: "I love you so much. I can't believe I'm doing this."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mrs Hales said: "My message is that it can happen to anyone."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Some 75,000 Irish people are profoundly affected by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , "a huge chunk of the population", and very little is being done for them, a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  awareness seminar in Tralee has been told.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The seminar was organised by Rotary International and was addressed yesterday by leading American professionals on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Six people are profoundly affected by every \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," Dr Edward Dunne, psychologist and president of the American Foundation of Suicidology said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Ireland has escalated in the past 25 years. In 1977, for example, there were 151 deaths from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , leading to a rate of 4.6 for every 100,000 persons; in 1998 there were 504 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , a rate of 13.6, and in 1999 the number taking their own lives was 439, or a rate of 11.7. It was fair to say that 75,000 Irish people have been affected by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  over the past 25 years, and were still carrying a burden that was little understood, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There has been a huge increase in the numbers of young men taking their own lives, something not noted outside Ireland, Dr Dunne said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "When a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  happens in a community, particularly if it's very public, it sometimes makes other people suicidal." In high schools in the US the danger of a cluster of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was "very real".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Father Charles T. Rubey said grief from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was different from any other form of grief. It was uncontrollable, lengthy, "like being on a ship that is washed around in a storm". Unless one has been bereaved oneself from a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , it was impossible to understand, he said. Father Rubey founded the support group LOSS in Chicago (Loving Outreach to Survivors of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ) in 1979.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "People's lives are unalterably changed because of a death from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The opportunity to grieve openly as well as to join support groups was a vital step in learning to deal with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 21 years, Father Rubey said, he had not encountered one note that fully explained why a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occurred. "Whenever there is a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  there are a lot of questions. Questions that often remain unanswered. Ultimately people have to live with the uncertainty. "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  needs to be understood as a death that is caused by illness." People didn't take their lives because they wanted to, but because they were in indescribable pain, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The community and the church should reach out to families where there has been a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  because they feel stigmatised, unwelcome and labelled as failures. "Forty years ago the church removed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from the realm of morality and placed it where it belongs in the medical field. The church removed the stigma. It is up to society to remove it now," Father Rubey said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fire \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  increase in Japan PETER WILSON: Tokyo BURIED among the latest government statistics issued in Tokyo is an alarming suggestion that increasing numbers of Japanese may be setting fire to themselves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the National Fire Defence Board, 1986 saw a 22.2 percent increase in the number of people committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with fire.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Listed under ""Deaths by Fire" was the fact that 804 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with fire last year compared to 658 in 1985. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Are the Japanese running around setting fire to themselves like the self-immolating Buddhist monks of Vietnam War days?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There was one notable incident last November in which seven women doused themselves in kerosene and burned themselves after the ""guru" of their religious sect had died.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But closer inquiries find that no, the new Fire Board statistics do not indicate a rise in self- immolations. Rather they point to a general rise in the number of Japanese \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and a cultural quirk about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ""with" fire instead of ""by" fire.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with fire _ when a person kills themselves by any method after setting fire to their home or valuables _ is also related to the most tragic form of Japanese \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , that in which a person kills his or her young children before committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This killing of one's young before \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a horrifying but age-old Japanese practice. It is widely explained as a belief that, in a society which emphasises the family unit and has little sense of community welfare services being offered by the state, surviving children would face miserable lives without their parents.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hence a mother killing herself in protest at her husband's adultery might first kill the kids.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This practice is recognised by Japanese courts to the extent that a mother who kills her children and then survives her own \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt will not be charged with murder. The whole act is seen as a failed joint \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and even American courts have used this cultural interpretation when dealing with such Japanese family tragedies in the States.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Multiple \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are relatively common in Japan, where 490 of last year's 25,524 listed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were classified as group \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Those figures do not include the child victims of such family \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and unwilling adult partners in multiple \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Japanese language has terms for all these types of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The ""shinju" or group/ double \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  include ""boshi shinju" involving a mother and children, ""oyako shinju" when both parents \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and take some of their children, and ""ikka shinju" or \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of the whole family.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ""Shudan jisatsu" are group \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  other than a family's.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to Professor Kenji Tamura, of Toyo University's sociology department, the important thing to distinguish about the fire \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the difference between ""shoshin jisatsu" or self-immolation, and ""hoka jisatsu" which means \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ""with" fire.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Immolation as a means of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is not that popular in Japan, he says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ""Hanging is most popular and jumping is also very big. In recent years city people have also been using drugs and gas.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ""These latter methods could be a sign of people who are not fully committed to the idea of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and who hope to be found before they die."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Guns are not used in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as often as in Australia, largely because Japan's tougher gun laws make them harder to come by.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pocahontas County had the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in West Virginia over the past 12 years, according to a study released Thursday. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Thirty-four people took their own lives in Pocahontas County between 1995 and 2007. Gilmer County had the next highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate, followed by McDowell, Mercer and Calhoun counties, the state Council for the Prevention of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reported.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Statewide, 3,491 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  during the past 12 years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "That's a lot of deaths for a very small state," said Bob Musick, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  council's executive director. "It alarms me. This is a serious situation."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Musick and other \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  experts weren't sure why Pocahontas County had the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Musick said residents in rural areas typically have easier access to guns. Also, an increasing number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  seem to be linked to drug and alcohol abuse, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "People see no way out," Musick said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Guy Hensley, chief executive officer of a mental health organization that serves Pocahontas and surrounding counties, said the county's sparse population - about 8,500 people - might drive up the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate. The rates were calculated based on total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I really don't have any idea why it's so high," said Hensley, who heads Seneca Health Services in Summersville. "It's such a small population in Pocahontas County. It may skew the numbers."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Monongalia County had the lowest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in the state with 10.1 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 people during the past dozen years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Braxton and Taylor counties had the next lowest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In terms of sheer numbers, Kanawha County had the most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with 370, followed by Raleigh (176), Cabell (162), and Berkeley (149).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The prevention council plans to provide training to behavioral health professionals in counties with high \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in the coming months, Musick said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We're going to get in those areas and do as much training as we possibly can," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The council also wants to expand a Kanawha County Schools \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention program to other schools across the state. The program - called Adolescent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention and Early Intervention, or ASPEN - helps teenage students contemplating \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Last July, the state Health Statistics Center released a report that showed West Virginia's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate among young adults is rising sharply.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among West Virginians between the ages of 20 and 24 nearly doubled over the past five years, the report said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Youth between the ages of 15 to 19 also are committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at a significantly higher rate, the study found.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Depression and substance abuse are the leading causes of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among younger adults, Musick said. Recent national studies also have shown that many young adults are struggling with credit card debt.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Musick said calls from West Virginians to the National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Lifeline increased last year. The national hot line reported 2,632 West Virginia calls from July 2007 to June 2008.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention lifeline telephone number is (800) 273-TALK.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We're just trying to get the people who are vulnerable to give us a call, so we can help them," Musick said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 BOSTON (AP) - The number of people who committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  dropped slightly in 2003, from 425 to 423, according to a report released yesterday by the state Department of Public Health.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 By comparison, 139 people were murdered in 2003 and 226 people died from the AIDS virus. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We know most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are preventable," said acting Department of Public Health Commissioner Paul Cote. "We will continue to build upon the plan for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention by raising public awareness through education, professional training, community coalitions and reducing the stigma of seeking help."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Males are three times more likely to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than females, though females have a higher rate of hospitalization for self-inflicted injuries that are not fatal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The largest number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2003 occurred among people 35-to 54-years-old, who accounted for 45 percent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate among men was in those 85 years and older. The highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate among women was in the 35 to 54 age group.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates were highest among whites, compared to black, Asian or Hispanic groups.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The most common method of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Massachusetts in 2003 was hanging or suffocation. The use of firearms was the leading method nationwide.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The state said as many as 90 percent of those who committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had at least one diagnosis of mental illness or substance abuse problems.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The state had 420 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2001 and 401 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2000.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Every once in a while, Americans are shocked, collectively, by
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 news of a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Most recently, it was the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Friday of
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Carla Hochhalter, the mother of one of the Columbine High School
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 shooting victims. Friends said when she shot herself in a suburban
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Denver pawnshop, she was deeply depressed over the massacre's
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 effect on her severely injured daughter.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sadly, her \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is national news because of her association
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 with the Columbine tragedy rather than because \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  itself
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 is news. In fact, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is appallingly common: About 30,000
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Americans commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every year. Another 750,000 attempt it,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 including 500,000 whose efforts are severe enough to send them
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 to an emergency room. Especially chilling is the fact that one
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 in five high school students says he or she seriously considered
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  within the past year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Like many of you reading this, I have lost friends, colleagues
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 and children of colleagues to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Like some of you, I have
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  myself, almost dying when I was 28 after slipping
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 into a coma from my intentional drug overdose while in the midst
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 of a painful and protracted struggle with manic-depressive illness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Because I now professionally research, write and talk about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 I am particularly aware that each of our 30,000 annual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 no matter how little or how well publicized, affects many people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Sometimes, those left behind come to listen or talk to me within
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 days of having buried the person who committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Still
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 devastated, they always ask: Why? To them, there seems no answer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But in fact, we do know a great deal about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  causes. More
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 than 90% of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  involve mental illness and/or the abuse
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 of alcohol, drugs or an alcohol-drug combination. Most who are
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 depressed will not kill themselves, but a majority of those who
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are profoundly depressed. Combining depression
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 with alcohol is particularly lethal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The biology of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We also know a great deal about the underlying biology of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 -- for example, that there is a genetic component to it that can
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 interact dangerously with the genetic factors implicated in major
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 psychiatric illnesses. We know that certain neurotransmitters
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 and stress hormones are deeply enmeshed in the volatility, impetuousness
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 and violence that are part and parcel of the moody and explosive
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 temperaments most closely associated with self-murder.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And violence is, disturbingly, an integral part of many \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 The igniting of volatile temperaments by severe psychological
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 stress, or by the presence of a depressive or other mental illness,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 can be deadly -- especially when in the presence of an easily
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 accessible gun. (Firearms now are used to commit more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 than murders.)
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 So, even if there is more to know, we do know many things about
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . What we need to do is use that knowledge more effectively
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At risk, yet undiagnosed
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We have, for example, effective ways to treat the psychiatric
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 illnesses most commonly associated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 : antidepressant
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 medications, lithium, psychotherapy, anticonvulsant medications,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 drugs to treat anxiety and drugs to ameliorate and prevent psychosis.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Yet most people at high risk for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  remain undiagnosed and
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 untreated. And we still lack public awareness of the symptoms
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 and treatments for depression and other psychiatric disorders,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 or how those disorders can lead someone to contemplate \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We need more aggressive gun-safety laws to try to thwart the means
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 of almost 60% of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . We also need better public awareness
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 of just how prevalent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is -- during the Vietnam years,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 for example, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  killed more young men than the war did --
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 and how the profile of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is changing to include more teenagers,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 more young black males, more elderly males. The surgeon general,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Dr. David Satcher, has recognized this and recently made preventing
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  one of his priorities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It should be a priority for all of us. There are reasons people
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . What we as a society need to do is help those
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 contemplating \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  find better reasons for staying alive.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 U.S. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sept. 05--In Tennessee, an estimated 900 men, women and children die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 More people die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year than from homicide, AIDS, or drunk driving. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the leading cause of violent deaths in our state, nationally, and worldwide, far above homicide and death due to natural disasters. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the third-leading cause of death among youth and young adults ages 15-24 in Tennessee and throughout the entire nation. According to the Tennessee Department of Health, there were 956 recorded \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths in our state in 2012, at a rate of 14.8 per 100,000 people. In 2013 there were 1,017 deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . In 2012, there were 15 deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Wilson County, which is a rate of 12.6 per 100,000. In 2013, there were 12, which is a rate of 9.8 per 100,000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In almost all cases, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be traced to unrecognized, untreated, or poorly treated mental illness. It can happen to people of either sex, any race or ethnicity and any economic status. The average \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  death leaves behind six survivors--family and friends of the deceased--all of whom are at increased risk for a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt themselves. As if the emotional and psychological toll were not enough, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts cost the state of Tennessee $1 billion a year in medical treatment, lost wages and lost productivity.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Tennessee \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Network and its allies in the public health, mental health and social service fields are joining forces to recognize September as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Awareness Month. During this annual observance, TSPN and its allies arrange several educational and memorial events across Tennessee. These projects help teach the general public about the problem of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and how it can be prevented.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SRINAGAR, June 8 -- More and more women are falling prey to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Kashmir. During the past 20 days, twelve \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have been reported from across the Valley. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Out of the total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , ten have been attempted by women. Most of the victims are young women and teenagers. There are reports of two-three \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every week.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to police information, two women committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on May 31, each from Anantnag and Tethmulla, Baramulla. Both consumed poisonous substances at their home. Fifteen year old girls made \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bid on June 6 by consuming poisonous substance at her residence in Peerbal Frisal, Kulgam. On the same day, a 45-year old woman attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at her residence in Bijbehara. A 22-year old woman from Abiguzar died after she set herself ablaze on June 7. A 30-year old woman committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at Kulgam today.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On June 3, 30-year old woman attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at her residence in Batpora, Khrew. On May 17, a woman committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by jumping into the river Jhelum from Cement Bridge.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the month of March this year, 12 women committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . While the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is rising with each day in Kashmir, women constitute 90 percent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Psychologist Prof A.G. Madhosh says insensitivity and impulsive nature make women more vulnerable to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . He cites family pressure, marital relations, employment issues, examination pressures and the inability to compete at social levels as reasons for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . He adds that performance in academics alone is not the reason for female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Social pressures play a major role to instigate women to take extreme steps. "Women face lot of social binding in respect of education, employment, marriage and family life. It gives way to mental stress which ultimately force women to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," Prof Madhosh said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Women do not get ample chance to express their pains and anger which adds to psychological distress. Different psychiatric disorders, like depression also lead to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , he adds. Sociologist, Prof Bashir Ahmad Dabla adds that mode of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are getting deadlier. Earlier, he says, people would threaten their families with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , without actually doing themselves any harm.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They would jump out of first floor windows or slash their hands-adopting measures that, though harmful, still left them alive. "But now, the most deadly substances are being used for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," said Prof Dabla. Experts suggest adoption of a practical system of education, counseling and religious education for preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Media coverage of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by prominent figures can lead to a spike in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates among ordinary people, a Korean researcher said Tuesday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A team led by Kim Nam-kug, an assistant professor of convergence medicine at Asan Medical Center, analyzed the 15 celebrity \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  most covered by the media between 1990 and 2010, and compared the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  following those deaths. They saw a correlation coefficient of 0.74 between the number of news articles and the number of deaths. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This means for every 100 news articles covering the celebrities' deaths, 74 copycat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occurred, Kim said. This "Werther effect," referring to an increase in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  after a widely publicized \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , occurs especially among people who deeply revered the celebrities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "People tend to think prominent figures are worth respecting, which leads them to mirror themselves after the famous people. This is more common among those who are vulnerable or depressed," said Kim.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The troubled fans imitate the actions of their heroes, even to the point of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and often take their lives in the same ways the celebrities did, Kim said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Data from 2013 by the Ministry of Health and Welfare showed that the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by hanging spiked to 1,197 in October 2008, more than double the previous month. It was the month when popular actress Choi Jin-sil died by hanging herself.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The total number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  over the next two months was 3,081, which marked an increase of 1,274 from the same period the year before.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The effect, he said, was not limited to singers and actors. When political and economic big names like former President Roh Moo-hyun and tycoon Chung Mong-hun took their own lives, the ripple effect was also felt throughout society in the form of mimic \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's more related to the amount of media coverage than the characteristics of the deceased," he said. "The reason a bigger celebrity prompts more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is because their deaths attract more attention from the press."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Last year, the Welfare Ministry came up with guidelines on media coverage of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These include avoiding the word "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " as much as possible, avoiding reporting details, not glorifying the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in any way and not using the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to point out social problems.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The guidelines, however, are rarely followed as many news outlets present graphic details of celebrity \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Although the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Korea is higher than in any other OECD country, there has not been enough research on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," he said, underscoring the media's role in the frequent occurrence of copycat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . "There needs to be stricter guidelines for the media on reporting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The study was published in the latest edition of the journal Epidemiology and Psychiatric Sciences.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Monday (Sept. 10) marked the 10th anniversary of World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While the number varies annually, from 2000 to 2010, statistics show there were 26 to 47 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in London each year. Of these, 75 per cent were males while the other 25 per cent involved females. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The leading risk factor for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is untreated mental illness, particularly depression.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to Children's Mental Health Ontario, a recent study found that 1-in-10 students in Grades 7 through 12 reported they had seriously considered \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and about three per cent reported attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide. Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among Aboriginal youth is estimated to occur at rates five times higher than non-Aboriginal youth.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To mark World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, the annual Lifting the Silence Memorial Walk and Ceremony took place at the Civic Garden. The goal is to raise awareness about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide and suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, while also honouring those lost to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and providing support to their families.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It can be a very difficult journey, the grief can be very complicated \'e2\\x80" especially with the stigma around \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " said one of the organizers Annette Dennis.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Support can be expressed in many ways, including the gift of non-judgmental support. Shame is one of the most challenging and prominent feelings around \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If you or someone you know is struggling with thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  help is available.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Namibia needs to strengthen its responses to the alarming rise in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the country, which have reached crisis proportions, according to Tuhafeni Katota, a social worker in the Ministry of Health and Social Services, based in the Ohangwena Region. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On Monday, Namibia joined the rest of the world in commemorating World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to Katota, September 10 was designated World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day in 2003.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 2009, Namibia started to commemorate the day.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Figures of people that fell victim to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , however, continue to rise alarmingly with close to 200 successful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and 284 attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases recorded between 2007 and 2012 in the Ohangwena Region alone.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Between October 2011 and now, 39 people took their own lives, while 110 people failed in their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts between March 2011 and September 2012 in the Ohangwena Region.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The youngest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victim was a nine-year-old boy who killed himself by hanging. He was identified as Matheus Amakali Enkali from Oidimba village.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The eldest victim was identified as Frans Shikongo (78) from Onuumba village. Shikongo killed himself with a shotgun.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Between 2007 and 2009, the Ohangwena Region had the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in the country, recording 118 successful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and 84 attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Last year, between January and September, 66 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Last year's youngest victim was 11-year-old Penehafo Kaleinasho Josua from Omahange village. She killed herself by hanging.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 2011, the eldest victim was 93-year-old Andreas Endjabi, from Okamukwa village. Endjambi died also by hanging himself in his hut.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We as the ministry of health, we counsel adults (18-year-olds and above) that have attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , while the ministry of gender offers counselling to children.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Life Line Child Line is our good partner in this battle, because in some cases people want counselling but they would prefer it done over the phone.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "In the same vein the Ohangwena Regional Council, mostly the governor (Usko Nghaamwa) takes it upon himself to organise \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  awareness campaigns and events," said Katota.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to Katota, despite all the efforts invested in campaigns against \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by stakeholders, cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are still on the rise.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Katota said there is an urgent need for stakeholders to redouble their efforts in the fight against \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and to strengthen existing prevention programmes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Nowadays children don't even go to Sunday school anymore, that is why people don't fear \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , they think it is a solution. In fact, when children see well-organised funerals of children that have fallen victim to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , they tend to think that committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is cool. At least with Bible studies and Sunday school children are taught to fear \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," said the Omusati Region's police spokesperson, Abner Kaume Itumba.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  warning signs include constant or regular depression, sadness, feelings or expressions of hopelessness, withdrawal from family and friends, being occupied with death or death wishes, irritability, neglect of personal appearance, alcohol or drug abuse and performing poorly at work or school, among others. A few victims do not show suicidal symptoms at all.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SUICIDE\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  IS becoming more and more common as many young people decide to take their lives for many reasons, such as, bullying, sexuality, depression, or grief. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among Irish children has almost doubled in a decade, according to a survey done by UCD Professor of Psychiatry Kevin Malone.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among children in Ireland under 15 has also doubled. Research also finds two children a month are taking their own lives. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Professor Malone interviewed families of children with no history of mental illness and he found out all of them had experienced some type of humiliation in the six months before their death. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One of the most infamous cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was Phoebe Prince, who immigrated from Limerick to South Hadley, Massachusetts, USA. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Here she got bullied by two groups of girls over her relationships with the girls' boyfriend. On January 14 2010, Phoebe had a day of bullying in which a girl threw a can at Phoebe from a moving car, later on that day she took her life. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates are different to boys and girls. Girls think about and attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  about twice as much as boys and tend to attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by overdosing on drugs or cutting themselves. However, boys are four times more at risk of dying of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as girls, maybe because they tend to use more lethal methods like firearms, hanging, or jumping from heights. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 All sudden deaths are traumatic for those left behind. It is estimated that every single \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Britain and Ireland directly affects an average of 40 people. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Family and friends of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims can suffer from depression, guilt, loss and post-traumatic stress disorder. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Those who are exposed to a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victim are also more likely to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  themselves. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among teenagers is different to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among adults. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Teenagers are more likely to act on impulse, leading to a rash \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt while adult \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is often because of long-term personal problems such as depression and medical illness. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As teenagers are more impulsive there is less indication that the adolescent is at risk for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SUICIDE\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  IS becoming more and more common as many young people decide to take their lives for many reasons, such as, bullying, sexuality, depression, or grief. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among Irish children has almost doubled in a decade, according to a survey done by UCD Professor of Psychiatry Kevin Malone.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among children in Ireland under 15 has also doubled. Research also finds two children a month are taking their own lives. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Professor Malone interviewed families of children with no history of mental illness and he found out all of them had experienced some type of humiliation in the six months before their death. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One of the most infamous cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was Phoebe Prince, who immigrated from Limerick to South Hadley, Massachusetts, USA. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Here she got bullied by two groups of girls over her relationships with the girls' boyfriend. On January 14 2010, Phoebe had a day of bullying in which a girl threw a can at Phoebe from a moving car, later on that day she took her life. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates are different to boys and girls. Girls think about and attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  about twice as much as boys and tend to attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by overdosing on drugs or cutting themselves. However, boys are four times more at risk of dying of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as girls, maybe because they tend to use more lethal methods like firearms, hanging, or jumping from heights. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 All sudden deaths are traumatic for those left behind. It is estimated that every single \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Britain and Ireland directly affects an average of 40 people. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Family and friends of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims can suffer from depression, guilt, loss and post-traumatic stress disorder. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Those who are exposed to a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victim are also more likely to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  themselves. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among teenagers is different to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among adults. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Teenagers are more likely to act on impulse, leading to a rash \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt while adult \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is often because of long-term personal problems such as depression and medical illness. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As teenagers are more impulsive there is less indication that the adolescent is at risk for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Not soon after our loss, in the midst of grief and wanting to better understand and prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , H.E.A.L. the Halton Hills \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Group, was born. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Throughout the past three years H.E.A.L has grown into a grassroots group working to develop \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, intervention, and advocacy strategies by increasing awareness and fostering links between those in need of support and those who can help. Our goal is to help develop a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  safer community.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On September 10- World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day- H.E.A.L., in partnership with the North Halton Distress Centre, will be hosting an event to present ideas on how we, as a community, can begin to speak openly and respectfully about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and how we can work together to create connectedness to address \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in our community.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Wallis Balog, safeTALK Trainer Consultant, LivingWorks will be the special guest speaker Thursday, Sept. 9, from 7-8 p.m. at the Cultural Centre, Halton Hills Library.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 September 10 marks the eighth annual World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day hosted by the International Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention (IASP) and supported by the World Health Organization (WHO).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The WHO estimates that approximately one million people die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year which equates to one death every 40 seconds; over 4,000 people die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every year in Canada.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the second leading cause of death among youth aged 10-24 and is the third leading cause of death among adults in their primary parental years from 25-49 years (CASP, 2004).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 H.E.A.L., the IASP, the WHO and CASP recognize that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is not always preventable, and is most often the result of pain, hopelessness and despair. However, many \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be prevented through caring, compassion, commitment and community (CASP).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There are many things you can do to help raise awareness in our community: safeTALK training through LivingWorks, writing to parliament to encourage our federal government to adopt a National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Strategy, and by talking to your family and friends respectfully about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After losing someone we cared deeply about to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , we were empowered by educating ourselves about mental illness and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as well as participating in training and learning about how \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  safer communities can exist through dialogue, compassion, and understanding.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Text of report in English by Slovene news agency STA
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ljubljana, 10 September (STA) - Slovenia is one of the countries with the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in the world, the National Statistics Office said ahead of World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day on Thursday. A total of 27,000 people have taken their lives in Slovenia in the past 50 years, which means a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is committed every 16 hours. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to most recent figures from the World Health Organization (WHO), Slovenia has the fourth-highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in the world, behind only Latvia, Belarus and Russia.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in Slovenia have remained more or less flat throughout the past 50 years. In the last decade, an average of 524 people have taken their lives every year, of which 405 were men.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There was a slight spike in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  between 2000 and 2006, when there were 25-30 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 people, but the number has receded to 20-22 in the past two years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Slovenia, every 45th death in 2008 was attributed to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Men are 3.5-times more prone to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than women, which is however a general trend in the world.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The most prone group to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Slovenia are male widowers or divorcees, while single and married women are the least prone.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Somewhat surprisingly, the average age of Slovenians who take their own lives is nearly 51 years, which dispels the notion that this phenomenon is limited to younger and middle-aged people. Depression is the most common reason for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among older people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Statistics show that people who try unsuccessfully to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are usually younger. Also, more women than men try to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but fail, whereas \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among children under the age of 15 is rather rare.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While age is not a major factor in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , regional distribution is, with major differences among the various Slovenian regions. Most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  happen in the north-east of the country, while the least in the south-west. There has been a spike in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the south-east in recent years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Two-thirds of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Slovenia are by hanging, which is typical of countries in eastern Europe, the Statistics Office said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hot line
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention lifeline telephone number is (800) 273-TALK.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pocahontas County had the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in West Virginia over the past 12 years, according to a study released Thursday. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Thirty-four people took their own lives in Pocahontas County between 1995 and 2007. Gilmer County had the next highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate, followed by McDowell, Mercer and Calhoun counties, the state Council for the Prevention of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reported.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Statewide, 3,491 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  during the past 12 years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "That's a lot of deaths for a very small state," said Bob Musick, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  council's executive director. "It alarms me. This is a serious situation."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Musick and other \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  experts weren't sure why Pocahontas County had the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Musick said residents in rural areas typically have easier access to guns. Also, an increasing number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  seem to be linked to drug and alcohol abuse, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "People see no way out," Musick said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Guy Hensley, chief executive officer of a mental health organization that serves Pocahontas and surrounding counties, said the county's sparse population - about 8,500 people - might drive up the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate. The rates were calculated based on total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I really don't have any idea why it's so high," said Hensley, who heads Seneca Health Services in Summersville. "It's such a small population in Pocahontas County. It may skew the numbers."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Monongalia County had the lowest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in the state with 10.1 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 people during the past dozen years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Braxton and Taylor counties had the next lowest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In terms of sheer numbers, Kanawha County had the most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with 370, followed by Raleigh (176), Cabell (162), and Berkeley (149).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The prevention council plans to provide training to behavioral health professionals in counties with high \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in the coming months, Musick said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We're going to get in those areas and do as much training as we possibly can," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The council also wants to expand a Kanawha County Schools \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention program to other schools across the state. The program - called Adolescent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention and Early Intervention, or ASPEN - helps teenage students contemplating \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Last July, the state Health Statistics Center released a report that showed West Virginia's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate among young adults is rising sharply.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among West Virginians between the ages of 20 and 24 nearly doubled over the past five years, the report said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Youth between the ages of 15 to 19 also are committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at a significantly higher rate, the study found.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Depression and substance abuse are the leading causes of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among younger adults, Musick said. Recent national studies also have shown that many young adults are struggling with credit card debt.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Musick said calls from West Virginians to the National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Lifeline increased last year. The national hot line reported 2,632 West Virginia calls from July 2007 to June 2008.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention lifeline telephone number is (800) 273-TALK.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We're just trying to get the people who are vulnerable to give us a call, so we can help them," Musick said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 THE Salvation Army, shocked by new figures showing one Australian life is being lost to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every five hours, is launching several major initiatives aimed at reducing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the community. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The programs are aimed at training people in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention and helping those bereaved through \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Research shows that people who have lost a loved one to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are at a higher risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  themselves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Salvos, who set up the world's first anti-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bureau in 1907, are launching the National Hope Line for the bereaved, and two online training programs to provide people with education and awareness in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention and support.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ``There are too many myths about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ,'' a spokesman said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ``It's a myth to think only experts can prevent it. It's a myth to think people who talk about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  won't do it. It's a myth to think you cannot stop \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  happening. It's a myth to think confronting people about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  may increase the risk. It's a myth to think suicidal people want to die.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The spokeman said many suicidal people want to live a better and happier life: ``What they are saying is that they need help and relief from the intense emotional pain they are experiencing.''

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 BOSTON (AP) - The number of people who committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  dropped slightly in 2003, from 425 to 423, according to a report released yesterday by the state Department of Public Health.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 By comparison, 139 people were murdered in 2003 and 226 people died from the AIDS virus. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We know most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are preventable," said acting Department of Public Health Commissioner Paul Cote. "We will continue to build upon the plan for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention by raising public awareness through education, professional training, community coalitions and reducing the stigma of seeking help."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Males are three times more likely to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than females, though females have a higher rate of hospitalization for self-inflicted injuries that are not fatal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The largest number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2003 occurred among people 35-to 54-years-old, who accounted for 45 percent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate among men was in those 85 years and older. The highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate among women was in the 35 to 54 age group.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates were highest among whites, compared to black, Asian or Hispanic groups.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The most common method of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Massachusetts in 2003 was hanging or suffocation. The use of firearms was the leading method nationwide.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The state said as many as 90 percent of those who committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had at least one diagnosis of mental illness or substance abuse problems.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The state had 420 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2001 and 401 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2000.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a horrific act. It is also uncommon in Canada, accounting for about 7 per cent of all homicides.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 1998, there were 38 incidents in which an individual killed, then took their own life. That is out of a total of 527 homicide incidents (which include murder, manslaughter and infanticide). 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The number of victims is higher than that because in some cases there are multiple deaths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Four young children and their mother and father are dead in Kitchener in what is believed to have been a murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  represent a small fraction of the more than 3,600 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Canada each year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The "why" of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a timeless, complex question that still flummoxes experts. That makes murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  especially puzzling, and there is little research on the phenomenon.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The mystery wrapped in a riddle is this: What pushes someone to not only turn their inner turmoil into \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but also take the lives of others with them?
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is considered a solitary act while murder brings the worst kind of aggression on others. Combining the two seems a paradox. But a psychologist who specializes in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  said the two have long been considered related.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Sigmund Freud said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is simply murder towards oneself," said Antoon Leenaars, a Windsor-based psychologist.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  notes clearly show the relationship: There is self-hatred but also hatred towards others."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In some cases, he said, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victim uses his or her death, and the wording of a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  note, to hurt others. It is a form of double aggression.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But then there are the rare cases where the suicidal individual escalates the aggression to murder.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What research there is suggests some common threads in murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A report titled \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Following Homicide by two Canadian academics suggests the most common type of murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a man murdering his spouse or children: "The closer the tie between the offender and the victim, the higher the probability that the offender will commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Robert Silverman, a sociologist at Queen's University and one of the report's authors, said about 30 per cent of men who kill their wives take their own lives, while just 3 per cent of women commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  after murdering their husbands.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In some cases, a murder is committed, influenced by drugs or alcohol, and the assailant is so distraught at their act they kill themselves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 An influential study of murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from the 1950s said the difference between the murderer who commits \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the murderer who does not can be explained by the "degree to which the act of murder destroyed a primary source of nurturance and love."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Others may be suicidal and devise a plan to kill someone else close to them. If an individual feels acute bitterness towards another, it is likely towards someone to whom they are closely linked.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Much of the difficulty in theorizing about motivation," said the Canadian report, "stems from the fact that both the homicide and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can vary in the degree to which they are premeditated."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In some cases, the level of premeditation seems obvious. In a shocking Hamilton murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 1995, a father took his two kids out to dinner, then killed them and himself with carbon monoxide from the car's exhaust.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Leenaars said media often portray murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as simple acts of extreme violence, rather than emphasizing the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  aspect.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said individuals who murder and commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  may have cultural motivations (such as shame from family breakdown), but also may have mental illnesses such as severe depression, delusions or psychosis.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said the Columbine high school massacre in the U.S., or the murder of 14 women at l'Universite de Montreal -- incidents that ended in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of the assailants -- are classic examples of murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Society wants to treat this as a violence issue. They don't want to face it that it is an indication of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , depression and mental disorder. Until people come to terms with murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as being a type of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , we won't have a good understanding of it."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Every once in a while, Americans are shocked, collectively, by
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 news of a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Most recently, it was the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Friday of
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Carla Hochhalter, the mother of one of the Columbine High School
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 shooting victims. Friends said when she shot herself in a suburban
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Denver pawnshop, she was deeply depressed over the massacre's
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 effect on her severely injured daughter.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sadly, her \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is national news because of her association
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 with the Columbine tragedy rather than because \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  itself
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 is news. In fact, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is appallingly common: About 30,000
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Americans commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every year. Another 750,000 attempt it,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 including 500,000 whose efforts are severe enough to send them
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 to an emergency room. Especially chilling is the fact that one
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 in five high school students says he or she seriously considered
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  within the past year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Like many of you reading this, I have lost friends, colleagues
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 and children of colleagues to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Like some of you, I have
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  myself, almost dying when I was 28 after slipping
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 into a coma from my intentional drug overdose while in the midst
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 of a painful and protracted struggle with manic-depressive illness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Because I now professionally research, write and talk about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 I am particularly aware that each of our 30,000 annual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 no matter how little or how well publicized, affects many people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Sometimes, those left behind come to listen or talk to me within
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 days of having buried the person who committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Still
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 devastated, they always ask: Why? To them, there seems no answer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But in fact, we do know a great deal about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  causes. More
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 than 90% of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  involve mental illness and/or the abuse
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 of alcohol, drugs or an alcohol-drug combination. Most who are
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 depressed will not kill themselves, but a majority of those who
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are profoundly depressed. Combining depression
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 with alcohol is particularly lethal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The biology of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We also know a great deal about the underlying biology of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 -- for example, that there is a genetic component to it that can
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 interact dangerously with the genetic factors implicated in major
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 psychiatric illnesses. We know that certain neurotransmitters
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 and stress hormones are deeply enmeshed in the volatility, impetuousness
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 and violence that are part and parcel of the moody and explosive
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 temperaments most closely associated with self-murder.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And violence is, disturbingly, an integral part of many \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 The igniting of volatile temperaments by severe psychological
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 stress, or by the presence of a depressive or other mental illness,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 can be deadly -- especially when in the presence of an easily
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 accessible gun. (Firearms now are used to commit more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 than murders.)
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 So, even if there is more to know, we do know many things about
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . What we need to do is use that knowledge more effectively

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At risk, yet undiagnosed
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We have, for example, effective ways to treat the psychiatric
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 illnesses most commonly associated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 : antidepressant
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 medications, lithium, psychotherapy, anticonvulsant medications,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 drugs to treat anxiety and drugs to ameliorate and prevent psychosis.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Yet most people at high risk for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  remain undiagnosed and
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 untreated. And we still lack public awareness of the symptoms
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 and treatments for depression and other psychiatric disorders,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 or how those disorders can lead someone to contemplate \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We need more aggressive gun-safety laws to try to thwart the means
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 of almost 60% of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . We also need better public awareness
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 of just how prevalent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is -- during the Vietnam years,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 for example, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  killed more young men than the war did --
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 and how the profile of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is changing to include more teenagers,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 more young black males, more elderly males. The surgeon general,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Dr. David Satcher, has recognized this and recently made preventing
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  one of his priorities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It should be a priority for all of us. There are reasons people
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . What we as a society need to do is help those
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 contemplating \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  find better reasons for staying alive.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Sir, - To say I am appalled at the Star's front page coverage of a young man who had drowned in the Liffey is a major understatement. This sensational media coverage of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is something we in the Irish Association of Suicidology have been battling hard over the years to discourage, thankfully with some success.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The media can have a positive or negative effect in the way they report \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The Star's colour photographic coverage falls disgracefully into the latter category. Images of young people floating face downwards in water may enhance newspaper circulation figures. Unfortunately such coverage has been shown to have an adverse effect on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates. I refer to the well documented worldwide phenomenon of copycat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or the so-called 'Werther Effect'. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The media can be a powerful influence for good, encouraging education and positive attitudes towards mental health. Sensational media coverage, on the other hand, may foster an affinity with those who committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and confer an aura of celebrity on them.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is our aim to form a partnership with representatives of the media to lay down ethical standards for the reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , suicidal behaviour and related matters.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The media can help by paying attention to the following points in the knowledge that they arise from valid research.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Avoid simplistic explanations of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Completed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the end result of a process involving many complex interwoven factors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Debunk some of the common myths about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  such as: "If someone is going to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  they are going to do it and there is nothing you can do about it".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Avoid how-to descriptions of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in reports - the less detail of the mechanisms used the better.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Avoid repetitive ongoing coverage of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  stories, especially of youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as this may promote an unhealthy preoccupation about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among the young.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Don't romanticise or glorify \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Some reports may seem as if the community is honouring \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Last year, the IAS highlighted the need for a national code of practice for the reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and related matters. The response was poor. Anybody interested in forming such a group under the aegis of the IAS can contact me at the address below or e-mail drjfc(at)iol.ie. Hopefully, this letter will stimulate debate and promote collaboration between individuals and community groups in dealing with what has become a very serious issue. - Yours, etc., Dr John F.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 IN Sydney in 1995, 78 young people aged 15 to 24 committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - 63 of them males. In other parts of NSW, 45 youngsters did the same according to the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics data. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The figures show that, per head of population, considerably more young people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in country towns and coastal areas than in the metropolitan area.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Almost 80 per cent of those who committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  last year were male.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the State's far west, the deaths of two young men represented a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in the 15 to 24 group of 57.5 per 100,000 of the estimated resident population, the highest in NSW.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This is four times higher than the State average, which is 13 per 100,000 of estimated population," Peter Burke, manager of the Australian Bureau of Statistics' Cause of Death centre, said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sydney last year had a youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate of 13.5 per 100,000, while the mid-north coast had 23.7, Richmond-Tweed district 23.6, the Hunter division, which includes Newcastle, 16.2, and the northern division 14.3.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Hunter division had the most young \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  outside Sydney with 13, 10 of them male. Youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the Hunter were almost a fifth of the 63 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the region.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, in NSW's central west, there were no \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the 15 to 24 age group, but 15 older men and women took their lives.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the NSW bush, inland and coastal regions, 37 of the 48 youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were male and in six of the 11 statistical divisions there were no young female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The 48 youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were almost 17pc of the 284 total last year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the Sydney metropolitan area last year, 480 people - 358 males and 122 females - committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The 78 youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  represented about 16.3pc of the Sydney total.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Burke said Australia had one of the worst rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - particularly among males - in the world.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 KEYWORD-HIT One \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every four hours in Australia By ELIZABETH ALLEN AUSTRALIANS were most likely to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on a Monday and least likely to on a Saturday, according to new research. A study by Riaz Hassan, head of sociology at Flinders University, has found that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is increasingly being seen as an option for the unemployed, the poor, prisoners and people who feel physically, socially or emotionally isolated. Reduced social integration and an increased sense of isolation were two causes of vulnerability to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  In a book, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Explained: the Australian experience, the result of 15 years research, Professor Hassan said that every four hours, someone in Australia committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  While the national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate had not increased in the past century, it had moved into different ""theatres of life". Australian \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates had increased with age until 1960, but people aged under 29 and people over 70 were now the dominant groups. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had decreased in the 40-60 age group. Family, health and financial problems and a sense of failure were prominent among the circumstances which preceded a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt. His research also found: \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  mortality was highest among men, who often used violent means such as guns, but \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was most commonly attempted by women. Female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had declined since emancipation gave women more interests and avenues for success outside the home. Family life appeared to provide security.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  MANY articles appeared in the national press in, the weeks after the National Youth Federation's conference on Young People and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but none mentioned the link between young gay, lesbian and bisexual people and high \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The exclusion of this issue from the debate on youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  needs to be redressed. The evidence from a number of studies on gay youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is frightening:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 - 30 per cent of all youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are among gay adolescents
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 - \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the leading cause of death among gay young people
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 - gay adolescents are two to three times more likely than their heterosexual peers to attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 - 30 to 50 per cent of gay teenagers attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 - almost half of those lesbian and gay young people who do attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  make repeated attempts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The lack of reporting by the press in Ireland is part of a broader lack of awareness. For example, last year the Irish Medical Organisation published Fergal Bowers's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Ireland. Nowhere in its 120 pages is the high incidence of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among young gays mentioned. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Another group that seems to be unaware of the problem is our legislators. In 1993 a total of 23 TDs and Senators spoke in the debates on the decriminalisation of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Only one (Senator David Norris) referred to the higher rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among young gay people, and then only briefly.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A pointer to the problem was published in Hot Press magazine. Last December it printed the results of a readers' survey, which showed that gay respondents were more likely to have considered \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or to know somebody in their family or circle of friends who had committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Obviously neither the Hot Press survey nor Senator Norris's comments carry the same weight as the studies cited above, which were published in medical journals or commissioned by the US Government's Department of Health and Human Services.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The lack of media coverage or political debate reflects a broader reluctance to deal with homosexuality among young people in Ireland.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One example is last year's Report of the Expert Advisory Group on Relationship and Sexuality Education. Explaining the need for such a programme, the report cites an ESRI study in which young people expressed dissatisfaction with their preparation, in school for forming relationships and friends of the opposite sex. Sexual orientation is only mentioned towards the end of the report, where it is included in a list of subjects for the senior cycle. Tough luck for the lesbian and gay teenagers who may need support long before their Leaving Certificate!
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ON the other hand, the report does note that sexuality education should be delivered in a school environment which values uniqueness and difference. Unfortunately, this is negated by the references to opting out for those parents and schools who have objections to relationships and sexuality education.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The American Academy of Pediatrics Statement on Homosexuality and Adolescence, published in October 1993, is a valuable starting point for discussion of the issue. The statement noted that "the psychosocial problems of gay and lesbian adolescents are primarily the result of societal stigma, hostility, hatred, and isolation". It warned that there is no need for premature labelling of one's sexual orientation, but did set a standard for health care professionals: "Providers who are unable to be objective because of religious or other personal convictions should refer patients to those who can."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If we adopted this approach for all who have dealings with young people whether through direct contact in our families or schools, indirect contact in the media, or in setting down policy for the professions and institutions in our society - then we would have made a valuable contribution to dealing with the problems young lesbian and gay people face.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It was more than 12 years ago when I first learned about a group called SAVE. Most people had never heard about it. I was approached by one of the founders after he had learned that my 20-year-old son, a struggling college student, had tragically taken his own life with a self-inflicted gunshot. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I was still in deep despair and semi-seclusion, as any parent would be, and considered ignoring the request to get together, when I learned that my invitee had also recently lost his adult son to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and a young daughter, too, some years earlier. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 My wife and I did go ahead and meet Al and his wife, Mary, two loving people who, along with others, have done much to change attitudes about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and, through SAVE, raise awareness about the importance of mental health treatment, thus helping to prevent unknown numbers of people from taking their own lives.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We are among the 4.6 million in this country who are survivors of people who died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Many of us and millions of others have been served by SAVE -- \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Awareness Voices for Education (www.save.org) -- a Minnesota-based nonprofit that celebrates its 20th anniversary this month.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It seems to me that most people learn the hard lessons about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  only when they have to, usually after losing a loved one.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Here are some facts: one person dies by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every 15.8 minutes in America; there are four male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for every female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Yet there are three female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts for each male attempt. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occur every day, all year long; they are not related to holidays, anniversaries or the weather.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We lose more than 32,000 Americans to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  annually, including just fewer than 600 in Minnesota. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is ranked as the 11th leading cause of death (homicide is 15th) by the Centers for Disease Control. For people my son's age, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the second leading cause of death (ages 15 to 24) in Minnesota. Seniors 85 and older have the highest rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . In the last couple of years. the fastest groups increasing in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates were youths 10 to 15 years old and middle-aged adults, both men and women.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As we have learned about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , many people have become more open and willing to engage in an expanded public discussion. The most important thing to know is that the strongest risk factor for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is mental illness (depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia) and that many who attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  never seek professional care. Substance abuse is also a major risk factor, with alcohol, cocaine, heroin or marijuana as the main conduits. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates are higher for those who are divorced or widowed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As SAVE has demonstrated for two decades, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be prevented through education and public awareness. Research has also shown that when used together, medications and therapy can be effective in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, including a more than 80 percent success rate with depression.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is much for SAVE and the rest of us to do, because the World Health Organization predicts that by 2020, depression will be the No. 2 disability in the world.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dubai: The Penal Law in the UAE prohibits people from committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or even motivating someone to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 People who attempt to kill themselves are treated as suspects and are prosecuted before the Misdemeanours Court. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "A \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt is treated as a crime and the suspect is referred to the Misdemeanours Court. The law forbids a person from trying to put an end to his/her life. Those who fail to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  may be prosecuted regardless of the reasons that pushed them to attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," a senior prosecutor told Gulf News.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, being an accomplice to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is also a criminal act in the UAE, and any person who incites or encourages another person to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  could also be punished, added the prosecutor.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lawyer Eisa Bin Haidar said judges frequently slap fines on those who attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Under Article 335 of the UAE Federal Penal Law, a suspect who attempts \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  faces a maximum of six months in prison and/or a maximum fine of Dh5,000," explained Bin Haidar.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Advocate Uday Al Kazwini said the idea of committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  requires courage because a person would be committing an act against himself.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The person who attempts \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is either very stupid or solidly fearless. The act of killing requires bravery so how about when it is to kill oneself? It is very silly to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  due to financial strain. Nowadays ordinary people are facing debts and many others are being born in debt as well\'e2EUR\'a6 so it's silly to end your life over financial pressure because this is something controllable. Laws here are deterrent enough to punish those who attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Meanwhile, if a suspect incites another person to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  then he/she could be prosecuted and face a punishment similar to that of killing or attempted murder," said Al Kazwini.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is preventable, writes
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SUICIDE\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a problem with a human face - maybe one you know. To overcome the monumental growth in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  we need a nation working together to prevent the preventable.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although the average age for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is around 35, almost a third of all non-fatal \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts involve adolescents.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has become a reality for many families, with 9.5% of all teen deaths in SA being \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - the fastest growing and second main cause of death in the 15-24 age group. And depression and suicidal thoughts occur at all levels, from high to low achievers, and among teens who are popular as well as those who are isolated. A nine-year-old has committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the National Youth Risk Survey, over a six-month period in South Africa 20.7% of youths considered \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; 16.8% made a plan to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; and 21.4% had made one or more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts. Nationally, 29.1% of the youngsters who attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the past six months made an attempt that required medical treatment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Every day in South Africa 23 people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and 230 people attempt to. Many \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  go unreported, yet access to treatment for mental health falls far below requirements.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is no transparent budget for mental health in provinces, and there are too few trained psychiatrists in the country. These statistics cry out for the government to implement a national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  surveillance programme.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While there are few \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts in schools, many pupils at risk exhibit warning signs in the classroom.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Here, teachers play a key role in observing behaviour and intervening when a teen may be at risk of self-harm - yet there is no compulsory school programme to help identify and cope with depression.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is often preventable: about 80% of teens give some warning. Teachers and educational staff must know what to look for and how to intervene. These programmes need to be rolled out as a matter of urgency.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 NEW DELHI: India reported 348 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and 418 accidental deaths per day in 2009, data released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) showed.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rose 1.7% compared to 2008 while accidental deaths, including those in road mishaps, increased by 7.3% over the last year. A total of 1,27,151 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and 3,57,021 accidental deaths were reported in 2009. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "A total of 223 males commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per day in the country while the number for women is 125 out of which 69 are housewives. Seventy-three people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on a single day due to illness while 10 are driven to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  due to love affairs," the NCRB report said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 West Bengal topped the list with 14,648 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  followed by Andhra Pradesh (14,500), Tamil Nadu (14,424), Maharashtra (14,300) and Karnataka (12,195). These five states accounted for 55.1% of the total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Delhi recorded 1,477 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2009. UP rehas a comparatively lower number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  -- 3.3% of total cases. The data showed that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among farmers had increased during the period with five states - Maharashtra (2,872), AP (2,414), Karnataka (2,282), Chhattisgarh (1,802) and Madhya Pradesh (1,395) - accounting for nearly two-thirds of all farm \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the country. A total of 17,368 farmer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were reported in 2009, an increase of over 7% over 2008.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Maharashtra remained the worst state for farm \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for the tenth year running. Tamil Nadu reported the biggest increase, from 512 in 2008 to 1,060 in 2009.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Poor states like Bihar (112), Orissa (154) and Jharkhand (164) reported far fewer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On the reasons for people committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , family problems and illness topped the list with 23.7 and 21% cases respectively.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It is observed that social and economic causes have led most of the males to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  whereas emotional and personal causes have mainly driven women to end their lives," the report said, adding the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  due to unemployment and professional/career problems showed an increase of 18.8% and 15.1% respectively in 2009.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Among cities, Bangalore (2,167), Chennai (1,412), Delhi (1,215) and Mumbai (1,051) together reported almost 43.3% of the total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reported from 35 big cities in the country.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, in terms of rate of rise in accidental deaths, the highest increase was reported from Pune.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As far as accidental deaths are concerned, road accidents accounted for 37.9% followed by poisoning (8%), railway accidents (7.8%), drowning (7.7%) and fire accidents (7%).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It was more than 12 years ago when I first learned about a group called SAVE. Most people had never heard about it. I was approached by one of the founders after he had learned that my 20-year-old son, a struggling college student, had tragically taken his own life with a self-inflicted gunshot. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I was still in deep despair and semi-seclusion, as any parent would be, and considered ignoring the request to get together, when I learned that my invitee had also recently lost his adult son to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and a young daughter, too, some years earlier. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 My wife and I did go ahead and meet Al and his wife, Mary, two loving people who, along with others, have done much to change attitudes about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and, through SAVE, raise awareness about the importance of mental health treatment, thus helping to prevent unknown numbers of people from taking their own lives.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We are among the 4.6 million in this country who are survivors of people who died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Many of us and millions of others have been served by SAVE -- \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Awareness Voices for Education (www.save.org) -- a Minnesota-based nonprofit that celebrates its 20th anniversary this month.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It seems to me that most people learn the hard lessons about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  only when they have to, usually after losing a loved one.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Here are some facts: one person dies by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every 15.8 minutes in America; there are four male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for every female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Yet there are three female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts for each male attempt. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occur every day, all year long; they are not related to holidays, anniversaries or the weather.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We lose more than 32,000 Americans to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  annually, including just fewer than 600 in Minnesota. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is ranked as the 11th leading cause of death (homicide is 15th) by the Centers for Disease Control. For people my son's age, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the second leading cause of death (ages 15 to 24) in Minnesota. Seniors 85 and older have the highest rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . In the last couple of years. the fastest groups increasing in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates were youths 10 to 15 years old and middle-aged adults, both men and women.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As we have learned about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , many people have become more open and willing to engage in an expanded public discussion. The most important thing to know is that the strongest risk factor for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is mental illness (depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia) and that many who attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  never seek professional care. Substance abuse is also a major risk factor, with alcohol, cocaine, heroin or marijuana as the main conduits. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates are higher for those who are divorced or widowed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As SAVE has demonstrated for two decades, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be prevented through education and public awareness. Research has also shown that when used together, medications and therapy can be effective in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, including a more than 80 percent success rate with depression.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is much for SAVE and the rest of us to do, because the World Health Organization predicts that by 2020, depression will be the No. 2 disability in the world.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Chuck Slocum lives in Minnetonka and is president of the Williston Group, a management consulting firm. He serves on a SAVE advisory committee and can be reached at chuck@willistongroup.com

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A CAMPAIGN has been launched to warn young Buddies about the biggest killer of the under 35s in Scotland - \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A group of young Scots gathered at Hampden Park to launch Choose Life's campaign Don't Hide it - Talk About It in a bid to save the 800 Scots a year who take their own lives.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Paisley Daily Express revealed recently how 22 people in Renfrewshire took their own lives last year. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  And we reported on how Choose Life - which is based in Paisley - hopes to reduce the number of deaths in Scotland by encouraging people to talk more openly about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  With an average of two people a day dying by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Scotland the campaign calls on everyone to talk more openly about it to help save lives. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Choose Life programme manager, Dougie Paterson explains: "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can and is being prevented in Scotland. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "But \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a taboo and difficult subject to talk about and secrecy and avoidance is common. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "This, along with the stigma associated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are major obstacles to effective \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention. There is a great need to change our approach to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and increase awareness and understanding about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "The overall campaign aim is to raise awareness and promote the message that talking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can save lives. Many people feel that talking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can increase risk - the opposite is true. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "People who feel suicidal often feel relieved to talk about their thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and want to stay alive." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Since the launch of the Choose Life strategy and action plan in 2002, Scotland's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate has decreased by 13 per cent. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Within this there was a 14 per cent reduction in male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and a 10 per cent reduction in female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The overall aim of the strategy is to reduce \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by 20 per cent by 2013. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Choose Life has set out a plan to ensure that action is taken nationally and locally through a co-ordinated programme of activity involving national and local agencies, voluntary organisations and self-help groups.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  patrols could be set up at "jumping" hotspots in Torbay as part of new national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention guidelines.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Torbay's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is currently more than three times the national average and healthcare professionals in Devon say work must be done to prevent such deaths. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Peter Aitken, chairman of Devon Partnership Trust's Clinical Cabinet and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Lead, said hotspots identified include high buildings, bridges and cliffs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suggestions to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  include erecting physical barriers at well known "jump points", placing signs at hotspots urging people to contact the Samaritans or installing telephone helplines and establishing dedicated "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  patrols" of volunteers or paid counsellors to patrol identified areas.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Other ideas include training non-health staff to recognise people and situations of possible risk as well as partnerships working more closely with the media on the reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The guidance on action to be taken at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  hotspots has been produced by the national Care Services Improvement Partnership on behalf of the Department of Health.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The guidance was written and piloted by Devon Partnership NHS Trust.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Aitken said:  "We will have around 20 such incidents (\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ) in the South West every year and we need to do everything we can to reduce them.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We are working hard with our partner agencies to reduce local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates, particularly where they are exceptionally high.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Torbay, for example, has one of the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in the country along with other seaside locations such as Brighton and Blackpool.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "For young men, Torbay's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is currently more than three times the national average, although part of this is undoubtedly linked to its location."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Aitken said in Devon, under the banner of the Devon Interagency Forum for Self Harm and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention, the team have pulled together local data on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , mapped the high risk locations and convened an expert conference on the subject. This work has included survivors of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said all evidence suggests lives can be saved when local agencies work together to deter \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in high-risk locations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate continued to fall last year and now stands at its lowest ever level.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The three-year average is now 8.5 deaths per 100,000.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Prosecutors yesterday launched investigations into several "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites" on the Internet for their alleged role in recent mass and assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Prosecutors said they would charge the operators of such Internet sites with abetting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  if their involvement in the recent series of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is confirmed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The prosecution will take the lead in the investigation of the Internet's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites as they are likely to harm the public culture," a prosecution official said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After a review of the domestic legal system, prosecutors concluded that the operation of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites could be punishable depending on circumstances.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However prosecutors said it appeared difficult to apply \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -abetting charges to those \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites, which some believe arouse suicidal impulse, that are not involved in specific \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases. Prosecutors said they would continue to delve into the legal system to determine the consequences they can impose for such Internet sites.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The prosecution's move is a response to the public shock at a recent series of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  allegedly committed by members of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites on the Internet.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A 19-year-old is in pre-trial detention after being arrested on charges of murder commissioned by the victim. The suspect, identified only as Yoon, allegedly stabbed to death a 29-year-old victim, identified as Kim, at Kim's request in Seoul last Tuesday. The two allegedly struck the 1-million-won ($910) \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deal after becoming acquainted at a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  site. In another reported \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , two college students were found dead in Kangnung, Kangwon Province. Police suspect that the two drank poison together after consulting a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Web site.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police said they were expanding probes on suspicions of more crimes committed through such \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There have been regular offline meetings among members of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites," a police official said. "We are investigating the members."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, many of the Internet sites in question were voluntarily closed down. One of the sites, identified only as "S," put up a closure message on the site, complaining of the media's viewpoint of the site.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We launched this site to overcome suicidal impulse together," the message read. "We're very disappointed at reports that view our group as weird."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Law enforcement authorities have identified about 36 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites so far, but reports said that there are as many as about 300-500 unidentified \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites. Critics say that such sites superficially consult how to repress suicidal impulse, but actually instigate the crime by presenting effective, non-painful ways of killing oneself.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  hotline run by Jan Hilarius does not necessarily try to talk would-be \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  out of killing themselves. Instead, they hear advice on ways to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , funeral arrangements and wills. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Dutch are fascinated by the legal uproar surrounding Jack Kevorkian, the jailed American \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  doctor, because physician-assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of the terminally ill are now sanctioned in the Netherlands.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Guidelines approved by Parliament this week allow physicians to assist in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of a patient suffering unrelievable pain who repeatedly and lucidly asks to die.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That does not mean \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is widely approved in the Netherlands, a nation rooted in Calvinism and Roman Catholicism. It still carries a burden of shame.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It is simply not accepted here when someone says he wants to die," Mr. Hilarius, 61, said last week from his office in Castricum, near Amsterdam.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We see \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as a matter of self-determination. People have the right to choose their own life and death. We want to break the taboo."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To that end, volunteers have counselled about 60 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -seekers since the service began six months ago. At least three have committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Mr. Hilarius said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Most callers have encountered some major tragedies in their lives," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One recent caller was a 54-year-old rape victim who had twice attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Dutch \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is relatively low -- 12.8 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per100,000 inhabitants. Hungary, Europe's most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -prone nation, has a rate of 40 per 100,000 inhabitants.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr. Hilarius' hotline, sponsored by the local Humanist League, has received support from the Dutch Voluntary Euthanasia Society, which has a similar program.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "My attitude is not to be rejective. For most of the callers, just having someone listening to their death requests is enough counselling for them," said Martine Cornelisse, the society's program director.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 More and more SA teenagers are killing themselves
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is preventable, writes
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SUICIDE\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a problem with a human face - maybe one you know. To overcome the monumental growth in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  we need a nation working together to prevent the preventable.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although the average age for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is around 35, almost a third of all non-fatal \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts involve adolescents.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has become a reality for many families, with 9.5% of all teen deaths in SA being \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - the fastest growing and second main cause of death in the 15-24 age group. And depression and suicidal thoughts occur at all levels, from high to low achievers, and among teens who are popular as well as those who are isolated. A nine-year-old has committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the National Youth Risk Survey, over a six-month period in South Africa 20.7% of youths considered \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; 16.8% made a plan to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; and 21.4% had made one or more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts. Nationally, 29.1% of the youngsters who attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the past six months made an attempt that required medical treatment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Every day in South Africa 23 people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and 230 people attempt to. Many \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  go unreported, yet access to treatment for mental health falls far below requirements.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is no transparent budget for mental health in provinces, and there are too few trained psychiatrists in the country. These statistics cry out for the government to implement a national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  surveillance programme.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While there are few \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts in schools, many pupils at risk exhibit warning signs in the classroom.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Here, teachers play a key role in observing behaviour and intervening when a teen may be at risk of self-harm - yet there is no compulsory school programme to help identify and cope with depression.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is often preventable: about 80% of teens give some warning. Teachers and educational staff must know what to look for and how to intervene. These programmes need to be rolled out as a matter of urgency.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention programs in schools aimed at teen-agers may actually stir depressed feelings rather than help youths who have tried to kill themselves, according to a new study.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although there was little evidence that the programs reduced \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides and suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts, "there was some evidence of unwanted effects," researchers wrote in the study, published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "There is a clear need to evaluate such programs to determine their efficacy and safety," the study said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 David Shaffer, director of the division of child and adolescent psychiatry at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York, and colleagues studied the prevention programs' effect on the attitudes of 9th and 10th graders who said they had tried to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Romantic View of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Those teen-agers continued to believe \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was a possible solution to their problems, the researchers found. The teen-agers said they were also less likely to seek help or to discuss their feelings with peers who had not tried to kill themselves.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the third leading cause ofdeath among people 15 to 24 years old.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A psychiatrist not connected with the study said the results support theories that teen-agers have a romantic view of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The study involved 973 teen-agers, 63 of whom had said that they had tried on two occasions to kill themselves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The students were divided into two groups, with 524 participating in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention programs, including 35 who had tried \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  The other 449, 28 of whom had attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  did not participate in the programs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The programs, some up to three hours long, were intended to raise awareness of teen-age \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by describing the warning signs of young people at risk and recommending counseling.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Help That Hurts
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Participants were surveyed about their attitudes toward \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  before and after the programs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Attempters exposed to programs were significantly less likely to recommend that the programs be presented to other students and significantly more likely to indicate that talking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  makes some kids more likely to try to kill themselves," the study said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Of the teen-agers who had tried to kill themselves, 26.7 percent thought the programs increased the chances that youths would attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Of those who had not tried \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  only 11.5 percent thought the programsmight increase \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The attitudes of those who had attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and who did not take part in the programs were not significantly more negative than those who did, the study said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Education Not Enough
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I'm not surprised by these results," said Dr. Jan Fawcett, chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at Rush Presbyterian-St. Luke's Hospital in Chicago who is an authority on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "You can't just get kids not to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by just educating them about the problem and telling them where to get help," Dr. Fawcett said. "It's not an intellectual exercise. There's more to it than that."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr. Fawcett said prevention programs should treat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as an illness, like depression, which can becured with the help of friends and family.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The programs should not focus on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and instead concentrate on the factors that often lead to it, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The problem is deromanticizing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " Dr. Fawcett said. "They see reports about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on television and may begin to see \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as a way to end their troubles or make their parents feel bad."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SURAT: The number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is increasing in the city every year. Deaths due to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are now higher than even murders. Psychologists and psychiatrists believe reduced tolerance level, social and financial reasons are a few of the many factors that are forcing individuals to take their life. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 2011, 100 murders were registered while there were 522 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases in the city. In 2012, there were 98 murder cases and 553 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the city. At least 51 murders were registered in the city and 276 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases were reported until June 2013.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  data revealed that more men commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  compared to women. In 2011, 306 men committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as against 208 women. In 2012, 323 men committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . This year 224 women ended their life. A total of 168 men committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2013 compared to 108 women who took their life during the year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Individuals commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  when their tolerance level decreases. Children are not trained to face frustration by their parents these days," said Rudresh Vyas, head of psychology department at MTB Arts college.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Financial or social reasons are the major factors behind \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases in the city," said Kamlesh Dave, associate professor in psychiatry department at New Civil Hospital (NCH).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Surat rural police started a telephonic helpline and counselling centre in view of the rising number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases. They were able to stop two persons from taking their life.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Government has promised to pump \'a31.5 million into research exploring how to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among those most at risk of taking their own lives.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The pledge comes as ministers unveiled a new \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategy that is aiming to cut the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate and provide more support to bereaved families 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Funding will be used to look at how \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be reduced among people with a history of self-harm. Researchers will also focus on cutting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among children and young people and exploring how and why suicidal people use the internet.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Launching the new strategy to coincide with World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, Care Services Minister Norman Lamb said: "One death to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is one too many - we want to make \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention everyone's business.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Over the last 10 years there has been real progress in reducing the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate, but it is still the case that someone takes their own life every two hours in England. We want to reduce \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by better supporting those most at risk and providing information for those affected by a loved one's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Around 4,200 people in England took their own lives in 2010 and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  continues to be a public health issue - especially in the current period of economic uncertainty, the Department of Health said. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is highest amongst men aged between 35-49, while men are three times more likely than women to take their own life, according to statistics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The new strategy, which is being backed by charity the Samaritans, is the first in more than 10 years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Under the fresh approach, the government will work with the UK Council for Child Internet Safety to help parents ensure their children are not accessing harmful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -related websites.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It will also aim to reduce opportunities for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by ensuring prisons and mental health facilities keep people safer. Improved support for high-risk groups - such as those with mental health problems and people who self-harm - and well as those bereaved or affected by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will also be offered.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Chair of the National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Strategy Advisory Group, Professor Louis Appleby said: "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  does not have one cause - many factors combine to produce an individual tragedy. Prevention too must be broad - communities, families and front-line services all have a vital role."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pune: Most people who take the extreme decision to end their own lives in the city are below the age of 30,more specifically,are in the age-group between 15 and 29,reveals a recent report by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).The report on accidental deaths and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ,which was published recently,also reveals that 'family problems' account for a large number of these \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the city as well as in the state.The report ranks Pune 18 th in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  death rate among a total of 88 cities in the country.The NCRB report,based on the statistics of accidental deaths and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2011,states that in Pune there were 675 deaths due to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .Among them,465 were males and 210 females.In 2010,the number was 646.The number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per one lakh population is widely accepted as a standard yardstick for determining the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ,says the NCRB sources.The all-I ndia rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  last year was 11.2,which is marginally lower that 11.4,reported in 2010.The report states that about 27% \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the city were due to family problems,and accounted for 183 cases.Among them,96 were men and 87 were women.There were no family or mass \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the city last year.In the state,however,there were 17 deaths in seven cases.Of these,one was a minor (below 18 years ).The NCRB,which is attached to the ministry of home affairs,and was instituted to empower the police with information technology,has been since 2009 collecting information on the number of cases where family members perform mass \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .The report states that 11 states did not furnish information 2011.In the city,the next major cause after family problems is illnesses of various kinds.As many as 153 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were due to illness,which accounts for 22.66 % of the deaths.Prolonged illness accounts for maximum \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as compared to other illnesses like cancer,paralysis,insanity,or HIV positive status.Last year,18 girls and women committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  because of physical abuse.A total of 19 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were reported to be results of love affairs,in which 14 were men.Eleven persons committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  following the death of their dear ones.In Maharashtra,a total of 15,947 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were reported,of which 10,887 were males and 5,060 were females.In the state too,family problem is one of the major reasons for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .Family problems accounted for 39.9% of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  last year,followed by 25.63% \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  due to illnesses.Of the total 4,088 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  due to various illnesses,2,639 (or 64.33%) were because of prolonged illness.National vice-president of the Indian Medical Association and renowned psychiatrist Devendra Shirole agrees that family problems is one of the major causes of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ."F amily problems are on the rise.There is a change in the lifestyle of people.Also,there are nuclear families now.There is also the problem of addiction.Younger people these days undergo a lot of stress if they fail to achieve their objectives,"he says.Shirole also stressed on the importance of helplines,observing that there are very few helplines in the city."Helplines can offer support and help the individual stop from taking the extreme step,"Shirole said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 NEARLY 850 attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were reported to the Ministry of Health in the eleven months between 2010 and 2011.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 An average of three people attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the mental health unit at the Windhoek Central Hospital each week during the same period.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the Ministry of Health and Social Services, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the leading cause of death in Namibia and it "is on the increase". 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This according to a speech delivered by the Deputy Minister of Health, Petrina Haingura yesterday at the launch of a workshop to develop a strategic plan to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Namibia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Psychologist Shaun Whittaker, who researches \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  issues in Namibia, said that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "is obviously a crisis in Namibia".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He added that Namibia has "one of the highest rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the world" and said there is an urgent need to be proactive in tackling the issue.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to Whittaker, the two main groups affected by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are young adults and teenagers. He said research indicates that the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate amongst young adults is the highest, and linked primarily to unemployment. He said that there "is a clear link between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and unemployment".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Haingura, whose speech was read by a representative, said other factors that lead to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  include "poverty ... loss of loved ones, breakdown in relationships, arguments, work related problems".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Whittaker noted that the high rate of alcohol abuse in the country could also be linked to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  numbers.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  amongst teenagers is fuelled by issues surrounding school, family and relationships.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Whittaker said that a particular issue which could be addressed in the next few months, is the publication of national school results in the media, which includes the names of students.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He warned that last year, after the publications of Grade 12 results, he was aware of three successful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and 12 attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  following the results. "We need to consider putting in student numbers instead of names," he suggested.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Statistics released at the workshop yesterday focused on the numbers of attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  which were reported to the Ministry's social workers between April 2010 and March 2011.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Erongo region tops the list, with 150 attempted cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  followed by the Kavango region where 130 people tried to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . In Oshana, 106 attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were recorded, 94 in Otjozondjupa, 65 in Khomas, 63 in Hardap, 53 in the Caprivi, 50 in Omusati and 38 in the Kunene region.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Furthermore, 26 people tried to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each in the Karas, Omaheke and Ohangwhena regions while 22 attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the Oshikoto region. The Deputy Minister said that the three day workshop should focus on getting "to the bottom of this challenge we are facing".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Whittaker said that there is an urgent need for an "effective prevention programme" in Namibia. He suggested that the first step would be to open a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention centre, which should focus on prevention programmes, workshops, training, counselling and other awareness raising campaigns.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We need to be more proactive", he warned, in the face of the "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  crisis" in Namibia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police statistics show that Namibia's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is significantly higher than the world average of 16 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  out of 100 000 people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 2003, the annual statistic was 22 out of 100 000; the number dipped slightly in 2004 to 19,9 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100 000; in 2005 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  increased again to 23,8 per 100 000; in 2006 it was 23,2; in 2006 22,4 per 100 000 people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 2008, police statistics showed that on average, 21,5 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  out of 100 000 citizens. The latest statistics, from 2009, showed that 22,7 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  out of every 100 000 people. Experts say the actual average rate could be much higher.

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pakistan, June 10 -- One of the leading reasons why \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases are not reported properly is due to the fact that society considers \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a crime. Additionally, the behaviour of the police and the fear of imprisonment in the case of attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  lead to the lack of proper reporting
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Society for the Protection of the Rights of the Child (SPARC) has been endeavouring for the rights of children in Pakistan for many years. SPARC's annual publication, The State of Pakistan's Children (SOPC), being published for the last 15 years, is just one part of their work. This publication not only serves as a baseline for researchers who are working on child rights, but also informs all the stakeholders, including the government, public and nongovernmental organisations about the state of children in Pakistan. This publication also aims at providing vital information to legislators and policy makers, so that policies in favour of children can be enacted, and Pakistan can comply with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SOPC focuses on the state of health, education, child labour and rights of children in Pakistan. The SOPC 2010 report, apart from providing information on the above-described topics, has also included a chapter on child \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . This chapter not only adds to the alarming facts about the state of children in Pakistan, but also describes the injustices and cruelty extended to children not only by society but also by their very own families.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is considered a taboo in our society. Not only does the predominant religion, Islam, forbid \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but the law also equates attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with murder. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in society as a whole are increasing because of the increasing poverty rate, social injustices, frail law and order situation and slow dispensation of justice. However, the fact is that the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in children is also increasing and, apart from the factors described above, some additional factors/reasons are also compelling children to resort to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the SOPC 2010 report, the chapter 'Child \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 : a grim fact of today's life' focuses on the growing trend of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among children in Pakistan. According to the figures provided in this publication, 187 children committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and 80 attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2010. It was further revealed that this figure is tentative because, in 61.2 percent of the cases, the age of people committing this act was not established. So, it can be ascertained that the total number of child \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is much higher. One of the leading reasons why \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases are not reported properly is due to the fact that society considers \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a crime. Additionally, the behaviour of the police and the fear of imprisonment in a case of attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  lead to the lack of proper reporting. Only those cases get registered that are reported by government hospitals and other related institutions. Most attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases are taken to private hospitals, so that they do not get reported to the police. All the cases of deliberate self-harm or attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are under-reported because of the punitive aftermath attached to them.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The chapter on child \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  further reveals that there was only a slight increase in the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases from 2009, which were 185 as compared to the 187 cases reported in 2010. However, there was a sharp increase in the cases of attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , which increased from 42 in 2009 to 80 in 2010. The chapter further informs the reader about the means used by children to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and, among them, use of poisonous materials was most common, followed by firearms and hanging. According to the data provided in the chapter, out of 267 cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among children in 2010, 132 used poisonous materials, 46 used firearms and 45 resorted to hanging. Apart from the means used for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the chapter also provides figures related to the reasons that compel children to commit such acts and, among them, parental scolding/punishment was the leading reason, followed by domestic disputes and worries. Additionally, the chapter also includes alarming facts related to the use of children as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombers. According to the data provided in the chapter, in 2010, a total of 62 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombings was reported, out of which four were carried out by child \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombers. In 2009, 47 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombings were reported out of which four were carried out by child \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Overall, this publication is a useful source of information related to the status of children in Pakistan. However, there are a few improvements that can still be made to bring this publication at par with others. First of all, the figures provided in the 'Child \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 : a grim fact of today's life' chapter have not been arranged properly and according to an ascending or descending frequency. Secondly, the photos given in the book have not been credited to the original source, which is not desirable. There is also a strong need to conduct primary research, instead of relying on secondary data provided by other resources and institutions. This is important and has also been mentioned in the publication that cases related to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in children, particularly girls and women, are always under-reported. According to the data provided in the child \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chapter, 2,566 cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were reported in 2009, out of which the total reported cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in children were 227 or 8.846 percent of the total. However, 1,521 or 59.3 percent of the cases were under-reported. So, if all these cases get reported, then the incidence of child \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can rise further.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Floods, the war on terror and poverty have left a large number of children at the mercy of other people. In the absence of state-owned facilities for children, there is a looming danger that these children might lose hope and resort to extreme measures. So, it is the collective responsibility of every one of us to support and provide means for the welfare of these children, so that they can have a better future.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The tragic \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of 14-year-old Daron Richardson in Ottawa leads me to make a plea for the media and all of us to destigmatize the reality of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and mental illness. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I applaud the courage of Daron's family to speak out publicly about her death "to remove the stigma of pain and fear associated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Many \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  go unreported in the media because of the fear that it will result in copycat deaths, especially among teens.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The news of a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be reported sensitively in consultation with surviving loved ones without the details of the death, but accompanied by the resources that are available to those who are contemplating \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is almost always the result of undiagnosed or unsuccessfully treated mental illness. My son, though not in his teens, died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , I believe because he was ashamed to reach out for the help that was available to him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Guidelines for the media in reporting on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are available from the Canadian Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention. I would urge all media to report on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  regularly with sensitivity.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Until our society confronts the reality of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in our midst, there will be no concerted action to prevent it.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 KARACHI - Despite of placard set on various locations of the City by several NGOs offering assistance to cope with the menace of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the ratio of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has always been on the rise.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Police data shows an unprecedented rise in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts during the current period of the on-going year when compared with the corresponding period of last year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  According to the statistics compiled by Sindh Police states that around 177 people tried to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , among them 148 people attained their desires during the period of ongoing year. However, statistics further point out that 29 people among the said total figure failed to attain their desire. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  During the calendar year 2006, as many as 127 people attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , 89 of them lost their lives and 12 were saved. In light of these statistics, a significant increase of 59 suicidal deaths has been witnessed so far during the year 2007.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The data also unveils that about 89 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Karachi alone, out of which, 74 were dead, while 12 were saved. However, the data of previous year from 1 January 2006 to 15 July 2006 shows 49 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , thus the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has increased and adds around 25 more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts in Karachi.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The data of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases in Karachi shows that half of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were committed in Karachi as compared to rest of Sindh. In view of above data, it can be observed that people living in urban areas like metropolitan city Karachi are more vulnerable to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than people belong to rural parts of the province.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The difference between data of both areas raised several questions that what are the factors, which lead to suicidal feeling among the people living in City. Dr Hyder Rizvi, Chairman Dept of Psychology, University of Karachi opined that very rare cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had been reported where a person commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  merely for one reason, contrary to this, in many \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases it was observed that person preferred to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  due to several reasons.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Rizvi said that lack of communication, lack of relationship among the families were the main reasons of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in urban areas. He cited that complexity of urban areas lacking the strong family ties, social isolation; broken families were common in the western countries, which result in frustration and more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Expert suggested several reasons which compel one to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  namely the death of a loved one, divorce, separation, or break-up of a relationship, losing custody of children, a serious loss, such as a loss of a job, house, or money.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The reported cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in posh areas have shown a factor of social isolation based on social disorganisation, the most prominent cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in DHA in which even women who were professionally doctors and businesswomen were committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  because their children had deserted them. The same thing has appeared in middle class family a 14 years old boy hanged himself to death because of the lack of parental attention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Dr Fateh Muhammad Burfat Chairman Department of Sociology/ Criminology and Population Sciences University of Karachi while talking to The Nation said that the multiple issues are behind the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  while extreme level of frustration compels to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Dr Burfat added that urbanisation has caused human isolation and the trend of nuclear family has increased the level of frustration.  Change in traditional family institution would make parents frustrated, as they could not get the attention of their children as they might expect.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Parents who bring up their children devotedly would surely seek same response from their children when they would grow old and if they do not acquire the same care from their children, the heightened level of frustration would render them suicidal feelings", he added.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SUICIDE\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  experts want the term 'committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide'\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  scrapped from everyday language to lessen the stigma associated with it. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was illegal in UK up to 1961, however, it still is illegal to help someone end their lives and you could end up in jail for up to 14 years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jean Carson said: "We're desperately working to dispel the myths surrounding \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "One way is to modernise the language by replacing terms like 'committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide'\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and all connotations of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  being sinful or criminal. We're working hard to introduce phrases such as 'died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide'\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or 'died through \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide'\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  which are less judgmental.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Increased awareness of the language will help decrease the stigma of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The stigma is related to the power religious and legal sanctions associated with it and continues to fuel misunderstanding about the nature of death by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Very often this stigma prevents them from seeking help in the aftermath of a death.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "But we all have a responsibility, families of people who feel suicidal or who have died, the media who write about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the general public who hear about it."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 THERE are many support groups and helplines available for people coping with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  issues:

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Recent events in Edmonton have emphasized that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  tragically affects us all. This year, more than 4,000 Canadians will take their own lives and close to 400,000 will harm themselves. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  continues to be the leading cause of death worldwide, taking away an individual every 40 seconds. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I supervise the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bereavement program at The Support Network. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a tragedy that affects the community as a whole. Over the years, I have met too many caring, loving people who have lost family members and loved ones to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Our greatest weapon in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention is awareness through education and advocacy. Canada is one of the few developed nations without an implemented national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention action plan. The Alberta Mental Health Board in collaboration with individuals, professionals and agencies has developed a provincial \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategy which, if implemented, will guide efforts to diminish death by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sept. 10 is World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention day. On Sept. 8, The Support Network will be organizing our fifth annual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Awareness March in hopes we can take a few steps closer to saving lives we may not even realize are in danger.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If you would like to join us at 11:30 a.m. on Sept. 8 to walk in honour of lives lost to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , raise awareness and decrease the stigma associated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , please come. For more information about the march, please visit www.thesupportnetwork.com or call 482-0198.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0    Re The New \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Bridge (Sept. 6): After reading the recent profile of a Toronto landmark and its connection to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , we were left with some serious concerns.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  This article is a potentially dangerous media portrayal of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  because research has shown an increased risk of imitative behaviour occurs when the technical details of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are described. Providing specific details about the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and more explicitly the popularity of the location glamorizes this method of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and could lead to vulnerable people emulating the act. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Media coverage of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  needs to be carefully presented to avoid providing a how-to-guide for people who may be at risk of committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . In the future, The Globe and Mail should avoid including the word \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in a headline or mentioning detailed descriptions about the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  method or location. Mental health resources for vulnerable people should also be included in any responsible story on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It is our hope that The Globe and Mail will take this opportunity to reflect on the possible implications of this article and will choose to be more sensitive to this mental-health issue in the future.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  PRISON \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates have tripled in the time prison populations have doubled, far outstripping the community \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Australian Institute of Criminology researcher Vicki Dalton said yesterday there had been a 240 percent increase in prison \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , with 367 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  contributing to a total of 787 prison deaths between 1980 and 1998.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It is estimated that the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the community increased by approximately 38.5 percent, while the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  death rate in prisons increased by approximately 75 percent over the entire period," she said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ms Dalton said Australia's prison population increased by 94 percent in the same period.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Total prison deaths fluctuated over the study period, ranging from a low of 17 in 1986 to a high of 75 in 1997, with an average of 41 a year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In that period, the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  also fluctuated, and showed a consistent increase from 10 in 1980 to 34 last year, with an average of 19.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ms Dalton said prison \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were overwhelmingly male, with an average age of 29.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hangings accounted for more than 90 percent of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and Aboriginal inmates accounted for 14.4 percent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Eighty-five percent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occurred in the prisoner's cell, while 20 percent of victims were serving jail terms for murder.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ms Dalton said this was a preliminary analysis of prison \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  data, and the subject would be examined in greater depth in further reports to be released this year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One would assess reasons for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , considering such issues as the length of sentence imposed and how much had been served at the time of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The other would examine Aboriginal \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in prison.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 AIC director Adam Graycar said future reports would attempt to explain the complexities of apparent motives leading to prisoner \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Policies and procedures in place for the identification and management of inmates perceived to be at risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and/or self harm, is also critical for further examination," Dr Graycar said in the introduction to the latest report.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The world of rock music and the subject of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have prominent places on the Internet. The death of INXS singer Michael Hutchence, who hanged himself in a Sydney hotel room, offers consumers of the World Wide Web a greater understanding of why people take their lives and what is being done to prevent that. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Canadian Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention and the American Foundation for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention offer excellent, practical sites on the subject. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Information and Education Centre is good counsel, while the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Advocacy Network is more political and American in nature.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Psychologist John Grohol has a good advice site on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention and counseling, while \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Awareness and The Real World reach out to troubled people, particularly young people. Author John Updike looks at the loss of another rock star, Nirvana's Kurt Cobain, in a terrific site.

UnfURLed, a strong popular culture site, chronicled Hutchence's work in the group and in movies. In memoriam, his family asked for donations to UNICEF and the Starlight Foundation.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention programs in schools aimed at teen-agers may actually stir depressed feelings rather than help youths who have tried to kill themselves, according to a new study.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although there was little evidence that the programs reduced \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides and suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts, "there was some evidence of unwanted effects," researchers wrote in the study, published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "There is a clear need to evaluate such programs to determine their efficacy and safety," the study said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 David Shaffer, director of the division of child and adolescent psychiatry at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York, and colleagues studied the prevention programs' effect on the attitudes of 9th and 10th graders who said they had tried to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Romantic View of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Those teen-agers continued to believe \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was a possible solution to their problems, the researchers found. The teen-agers said they were also less likely to seek help or to discuss their feelings with peers who had not tried to kill themselves.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the third leading cause ofdeath among people 15 to 24 years old.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A psychiatrist not connected with the study said the results support theories that teen-agers have a romantic view of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The study involved 973 teen-agers, 63 of whom had said that they had tried on two occasions to kill themselves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The students were divided into two groups, with 524 participating in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention programs, including 35 who had tried \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  The other 449, 28 of whom had attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  did not participate in the programs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The programs, some up to three hours long, were intended to raise awareness of teen-age \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by describing the warning signs of young people at risk and recommending counseling.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Help That Hurts
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Participants were surveyed about their attitudes toward \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  before and after the programs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Attempters exposed to programs were significantly less likely to recommend that the programs be presented to other students and significantly more likely to indicate that talking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  makes some kids more likely to try to kill themselves," the study said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Of the teen-agers who had tried to kill themselves, 26.7 percent thought the programs increased the chances that youths would attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Of those who had not tried \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  only 11.5 percent thought the programsmight increase \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The attitudes of those who had attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and who did not take part in the programs were not significantly more negative than those who did, the study said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Education Not Enough
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I'm not surprised by these results," said Dr. Jan Fawcett, chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at Rush Presbyterian-St. Luke's Hospital in Chicago who is an authority on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "You can't just get kids not to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by just educating them about the problem and telling them where to get help," Dr. Fawcett said. "It's not an intellectual exercise. There's more to it than that."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr. Fawcett said prevention programs should treat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as an illness, like depression, which can becured with the help of friends and family.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The programs should not focus on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and instead concentrate on the factors that often lead to it, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The problem is deromanticizing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " Dr. Fawcett said. "They see reports about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on television and may begin to see \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as a way to end their troubles or make their parents feel bad."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In today's stressful world, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases are on the rise. With a view to prevent the increasing number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases, September 10 is celebrated as World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day. This year is the 51st year of the implementation of the noble initiative. According to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  related cases reported to GVK EMRI 108 Services, in the last five years the number of women taking their own lives has increased considerably, compared to men.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to figures provided by the 108 Services in 2007, of the total number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  committed, 44% were attributed to men and the women's rate was 56%. In 2010, women \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases were 61% of the total, and the corresponding figure for men was 39%.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 2011, women's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  share was 60% while the men's rate remained 40%.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Interestingly, if we talk about the cities contributing to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases, Ahmedabad leads the rest with 14% share of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases, while Surat and Vadodara are far behind at 8% and Rajkot has 9% share. Also, if the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases of the last three years are taken into account, then Ahmedabad has the highest figure - 3,380 cases till now reported to GVK EMRI Services - while 1,758 cases were reported from Surat.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The age group which commits the most number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Gujarat is 20-30 years. Stressful life, work and study pressure and impulsive behaviour are some of the reasons for the rising \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate among youth. Also, the background of the victims indicates that poverty is not the prime reasons for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . A majority of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims in Gujarat fall in the above poverty line category and are from rural areas.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Subodh Satywadi, Chief Operating Officer, GVK EMRI 108, Gujarat, said, "Various international studies show that not all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be prevented, but majority can be halted. Only one quarter of the people who die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  get in contact with health care services."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If one considers global figures, around 1 million people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every year. Interestingly, according to a WHO report, India is the leading country along with China with 99 in every 1 lakh people committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Reaching out to people who make suicidal comments plays a key part in preventing the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that occur each year, said York County Coroner Barry Bloss.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And although the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in York County declined significantly in 2010, the 59 that occurred still ranked as the second-highest of any single year in the past decade, Bloss said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The York County Coroner's Office recorded 75 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2009. That was up from 49 in 2008 and 50 the year before.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Bloss couldn't pinpoint an exact reason for last year's spike, but said financial stress was to blame for at least two of the deaths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Survivors of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims often blame themselves for overlooking comments that might have foreshadowed the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Bloss said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And the slightest hints toward suicidal thoughts need to be taken seriously, he said, because a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victim might have thought their loved ones didn't care since they never reached out to help.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Two 18-year-olds were last year's youngest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims in York County; the oldest was 87.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And more than 40 percent of last year's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims were between the ages of 40 and 59, according to the report.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For people age 65 and older, health concerns tend to be the top reason for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Bloss said, while it appears marital or relationship problems are a big reason for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among middle-aged people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Bloss is pleased there were no \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among high school-age teens last year, and said he'd like to link the good news to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention committees throughout school districts in York County.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Motive for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 : It's impossible to know what goes through the minds of people who kill themselves, said Dr. Allen Miller, director of behavioral health at WellSpan Health.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But it seems the bulk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  tend to stem from intimate relationships that have ended, said Miller.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 White single men in their 50s, who are divorced or never been married and are isolated from people are at high risk for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Miller said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There's a higher rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among people who live in isolated areas, Miller said, noting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in Wyoming are greater than in New York state.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "That supports the point that the more isolated someone feels, the more likely they are to think of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," he added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Miller said WellSpan provides a full range of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention services, including a crisis intervention hotline and walk-in center in York Hospital's emergency room.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In any given month, WellSpan's Crisis Intervention deals with 3,000 contacts, he added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 WellSpan officials plan to open another crisis intervention center next month on Edgar Street in York.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a global issue and a leading cause 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 of death in the world claiming lives of around one million people every 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a multi-dimensional disorder, which results from a complex 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 interaction of biological, genetic, psychological and environmental 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 factors, said eminent psychiatric of Sir Cowasji Jehangir (S.C.J.)  
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Institute of Psychiatry,  Hyderabad Dr. Darya Khan Laghari, Thursday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      Dr. Darya Khan Laghari, said that some psychology experts also agree 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 with the fact that majority of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are usually linked to 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 economic difficulties but there are  other reasons behind committing of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and these reasons can be depressive disorders, unemployment, domestic violence, parental separation, growing economic instability, 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 child abuse, bullying, rising inflation and loss of social cohesion which 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 force a person to end his or her life or release them from the pain they 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 are suffering from.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      Talking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombing he said a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bomber blows himself, 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 also causing an immense and fatal destruction in the areas around it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 He added that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombing is also one of the ways  that enable a 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 person to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and end his life through such a sinful way.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      He said that these are some instances, which appear through media as 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 many cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Pakistan are not reported.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      In recent years, psychiatrist  said that Pakistan has witnessed a 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 drastic increase in the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but the basic thing is that it does not collect national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  statistics nor report them to WHO (World Health Organization) so due to that it has become very difficult to compile  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  statistics and thus made the planning of prevention programmes, almost impossible.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       He said that the facts showed  that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has not only become a 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 health problem in Pakistan, but that there are no official statistics and national rates are unknown. The other reason to support this aspect is also that when a person attempts \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  his or her family usually tries to 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 cover this act and claims this incident as merely an incident thus it is becoming difficult for Pakistan to compile national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  statistics and report them to the WHO, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      He said the  rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is consistently higher in men than women 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 and men outnumber women by 2:1 and there are more single then married men
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 involved.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      He said that the surveys and analysis showed that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0   has 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 become more common in youth than in adult in many countries and Pakistan 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 is one of them. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates among youth are increasing due to 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 unemployment, pressure of work and studies, depression, anxiety and 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 increasing poverty, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      Dr. Darya Khan Laghari further elaborated that Pakistan's population 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 is 162 million and it is ranked as the 6th most populous country in the world. The official unemployment stands at 12 percent of the eligible workforce and health spending is only 0.7 percent of the national annual budget, he said and added that Pakistan is also a Muslim country and according to Islam \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is considered forbidden and prohibited.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      Islam is the only religion that has a clear scriptural ban on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 so, it has an independent effect on lowering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates but still many 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  everyday in Pakistan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      According to World Health Organisation (WHO) statistics, he said that 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 more than a million people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year worldwide, while the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt is successful 10-20 times.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      He said that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and depression are linked to each other as more 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 than 80 percent of people who commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  suffer from depression. He 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 said studies suggest that lifetime risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in people with 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 depression was 15 percent, with alcoholism 7-15 percent and with schizophrenia, 4-10 percent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      However, a substantial proportion of people  commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  die 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 without having seen a mental health professional, he said and added that detection,  referral and management of psychiatric disorders in primary 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 care was an important step in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sri Lanka, Sept. 10 -- This years theme for International World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day which falls on September 10 is, '\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention: One World Connected.' The theme reflects on the fact that connections are important at several levels if we are to combat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - at an individual level, cross support services and cross country/countries.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a serious public health problem. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occurs all over the world and can take place at almost any age. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the second leading cause of death globally among those between the ages of 15 and 29. According to WHO's first global report on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention more than 800,000 people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every year -- one person every 40 seconds. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although the rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have reduced in Sri Lanka over the years, new official data shows that Sri Lanka still has one of highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in the world, with almost 4,000 people killing themselves every year or about 11 a day with the majority aged between 15 and 44.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While the link between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and mental disorders (in particular, depression and alcohol use disorders) is well established, many \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  happen impulsively in moments of crisis as a result of a breakdown in the ability to deal with life's stresses, such as financial problems, sudden and major changes in people's lives, such as job losses or separation of a partner, relationship break-up or chronic pain and illness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "A suicidal person may not ask for help, but that doesn't mean that help isn't wanted. Most people who commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  don't want to die -- they just want to stop hurting. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention starts with recognising the warning signs and taking them seriously"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In addition, experiencing conflict, disaster, violence, abuse, or loss and a sense of isolation are strongly associated with suicidal behaviour. By far the strongest risk factor for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a previous \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are preventable. Reducing access to means of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is one way to reduce deaths. Other effective measures include responsible reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the media, and early identification and treatment of mental and substance-use disorders, particularly depression, which is an important risk factor for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Follow-up care by health workers through regular contact, including by phone or home visits, for people who have attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , together with provision of community support, are essential, because people who have already attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are at the greatest risk of trying again.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicidal intent of Children, adolescents and the elderly should be taken into consideration seriously. Both youth and older adults are at a high risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .Bullying is an extremely serious problem, which trigger suicidal thoughts in youth. Other suicidal factors among youth include loss of romantic relationships, inability to cope with academic challenges and life's stresses.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A suicidal person may not ask for help, but that doesn't mean that help isn't wanted. Most people who commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  don't want to die -- they just want to stop hurting.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention starts with recognising the warning signs and taking them seriously. Seek professional help.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If you think a friend or family member is considering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , you might be afraid to bring up the subject. But talking openly about suicidal thoughts and feelings can save a life. If a friend or family member is suicidal, the best way to help is by offering an empathetic, listening ear to them. Good family support, resorting to religious means, improving positive life skills to resolve crisis or problem situations in life can save a person's life.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The State of West Virginia has issued the following news release:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In its efforts to better understand \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among all its components, the Department of Defense released its first quarterly \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  report (QSR), today, for the four quarters of 2013.

It also reports 2012 annual counts and annual rates as published in the department's 2012 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Event Report (DoDSER) annual report. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Department of Defense considers one loss to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  too many, and will continue to do everything possible to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in our military. The QSR is intended to communicate the department's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  data on a routine and frequent basis.

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 PANJIM, Sept. 23 -- Just like the 2002 Japanese horror film '\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Club', Goa is notorious for unconnected \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . By this norm, the week was not exceptional though, but three \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on one day ~Tuesday, the week following the joyous festivity of Ganesh Chaturthi, though unnoticed, were indeed disturbing as the trend of self destruction continues in Goa. Two young women, one from Goa and another from Jharkhand and a Britona youth committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by hanging themselves in three unconnected incidents.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The 24 year old from Britona, who was residing alone after his father died just about 45 days prior, was found hanging from the rafter. The young woman from Jharkhand residing at Sangolda and the other from Sanguem both hanged themselves with a dupatta. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Though these may be just three silent statistics, which will slide into dusty police registers, the question is, is the government or ivory tower academics interested to study the phenomena that bedevils the state, in which they are employed and get paid from the public exchequer?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The stark revelation is that at on an average least one person commits \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every day in Goa, with the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  crossing 277 in 2011 and 291 in 2012. This year, by August 22, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had crossed 193 in this devastating trend. While majority of those doing themselves to death include Goans, there is sizeable population from other states who choose to end their lives here. In 2009, there were 278 cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , while 2010 was the worst year with 310 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In India, the more prosperous southern states such as Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala show a higher \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate than the northern states. It is estimated that half million people die of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every year worldwide, of which 20% are Indians. A recent India study suggests that family problems and illness account for 25.6% and 20.8% respectively. Drug abuse, love affairs, bankruptcy, dowry disputes which account for 3.3%, 3.2%, 2%, 1.9% and 1.6% respectively were the other causes of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in India.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  due to drug abuse or addiction have risen, whereas those caused by fall in social reputation, failure in exams, property dispute have shown a decreasing percentage rate during last three years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Goa, too the trends show that teens, adults and even aged are not immune from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and family problems, illness (physical and mental), love affairs, unemployment and dowry, are the main reasons for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Academic pressure, marital problems, old age loneliness, work related pressures and competition also drives people to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Emile Durkheim, whose study is still considered the most influential for more than 100 years posited that, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cannot simply be explained by individual psychological problems-otherwise \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates would be static. Therefore, the need to critically analyse the trends, behind the disturbing behaviour in Goa. On observing macro trends in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Durkheim's explanation seems plausible that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as a social phenomenon are linked to integration, or the extent to which people feel attachment to society, and regulation, or the degree of external controls on people. Durkheim's four-fold typology explains \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  around these two social facts ~ Egoistic \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  which result from a lack of integration, loneliness and alienation from a group, peers or family results in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; altruistic \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  which results from too much integration with a deviant group of maybe peers; anomic \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  which results from too little regulation and freedom bordering on licence; and fatalistic \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  which result from too much regulation from domineering authority or parents. Though these explanations are contested, the necessity to have authentic studies on rising trends in all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but especially among the youth is exigent, given Goa's rising economic prosperity, decline from traditional and family values and alienation faced by individuals vis-a-vis society, so as to look for credible measures to arrest the disturbing trend and prevent loss of especially precious young lives.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A NEW training program has been developed to address the high rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Mount Isa.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Reportedly one of the highest rates in Australia, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in North West Queensland has been an ongoing crisis. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 North West Queensland Action Group 4 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention adopted the training package, SafeTALK (\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Alertness for Everyone), in an effort to increase community awareness about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , including where to get help or advice.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SafeTALK is a LivingWorks program that trains community members to recognise people with thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and connect them to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  intervention resources.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The recently developed safeTALK training package addresses circumstances relating to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and how to talk to youth about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and sensitive issues and is available for schools, the police, and service providers to hand out to parents and young people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A spokesperson for the action group said the safeTALK program has been designed as a three hour program that shows how alertness to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  risk can be followed by basic steps that facilitate links with further \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  first aid help.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The emphasis is on fulfilling this vital linking role with local community resources rather than full engagement in a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  first aid intervention. It is a presentation rather than workshop format," the spokesperson said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It will stimulate people to think and hopefully act differently when signs of potential \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  risk are present."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Anglicare program manager Leeanne Harris is a member of the action group and said the group seeks to ensure that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention training and information is available to both community and service providers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's about having an understanding that we needed to do something locally within the community," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It was an understanding that for us as a group, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is everybody's business.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "When we talk about social and emotional wellbeing, we need to have an understanding about what works in our community."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The safeTALK program is free to anyone over the age of 15 and will be run once a month in Mount Isa during 2013.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A CEREMONY of hope and healing is being held by the Mental Health Association of Central Australia (MHACA) on World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day -- Tuesday, September 6. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The event is part of an international initiative to raise public awareness of the severity of the problem of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but also to learn about effective \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention approaches in Central Australia and what support is out there for families and communities at a local level.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The theme for World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day 2011 is Preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Multicultural Societies.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This recognises the need for cultural sensitivity in all our efforts to reduce \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Central Australia, a training tool has been developed called \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Story training.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This training tool has been developed out of interviews with Central Australian indigenous people about their understanding and knowledge of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in their lives.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It demonstrates the importance of local ideas to address local problems.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Other strategies can have a universal effect.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Educating professionals and the community in general about how to identify people at risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , encouraging help seeking and providing them with needed and adequate help can reduce rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Restricting the access to whatever means are commonly used has been effective in many countries in reducing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Safe storage of firearms, or restricted access to firearms, and restricting access to bridges and other high points is an effective \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Provision of appropriate and timely support for people (including children) bereaved by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can also go a long way in reducing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  risk.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The ceremony is a chance to have less silence and more understanding about the issue of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is still a lot of fear, shame and misunderstanding surrounding \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that is driven by personal beliefs and experiences and sometimes from misinformation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This day is an attempt to create greater public awareness, an improved understanding that many \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be prevented, and a compassionate understanding that this issue could and does impact on any of us.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The ceremony will be at the memorial site on the lawns between the Senior Citizens Centre and the Totem Theatre from 4pm to 5.30pm.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Recently in the NT, it has been announced that a Select Committee has been formed to look into the issue of youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 MHACA welcomes input from young people, parents and those who work with young people.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Reaching out to people who make suicidal comments plays a key part in preventing the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that occur each year, said York County Coroner Barry Bloss.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And although the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in York County declined significantly in 2010, the 59 that occurred still ranked as the second-highest of any single year in the past decade, Bloss said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The York County Coroner's Office recorded 75 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2009. That was up from 49 in 2008 and 50 the year before.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Bloss couldn't pinpoint an exact reason for last year's spike, but said financial stress was to blame for at least two of the deaths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Survivors of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims often blame themselves for overlooking comments that might have foreshadowed the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Bloss said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And the slightest hints toward suicidal thoughts need to be taken seriously, he said, because a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victim might have thought their loved ones didn't care since they never reached out to help.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Two 18-year-olds were last year's youngest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims in York County; the oldest was 87.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And more than 40 percent of last year's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims were between the ages of 40 and 59, according to the report.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For people age 65 and older, health concerns tend to be the top reason for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Bloss said, while it appears marital or relationship problems are a big reason for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among middle-aged people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Bloss is pleased there were no \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among high school-age teens last year, and said he'd like to link the good news to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention committees throughout school districts in York County.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Motive for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 : It's impossible to know what goes through the minds of people who kill themselves, said Dr. Allen Miller, director of behavioral health at WellSpan Health.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But it seems the bulk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  tend to stem from intimate relationships that have ended, said Miller.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 White single men in their 50s, who are divorced or never been married and are isolated from people are at high risk for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Miller said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There's a higher rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among people who live in isolated areas, Miller said, noting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in Wyoming are greater than in New York state.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "That supports the point that the more isolated someone feels, the more likely they are to think of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," he added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Miller said WellSpan provides a full range of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention services, including a crisis intervention hotline and walk-in center in York Hospital's emergency room.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In any given month, WellSpan's Crisis Intervention deals with 3,000 contacts, he added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 WellSpan officials plan to open another crisis intervention center next month on Edgar Street in York.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 THE \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  death of his stepdaughter came as such a shock to Peter Dicker's family they had no idea where to turn for help with their grieving.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Dapto family mostly dealt with the death alone, and 12 months later, in 2007, another family member committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the same manner. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That was too much for Mr Dicker, who has since campaigned for better post-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  services and publicity of such information.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We'll never know what the link was (between the two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ) but there seemed to be some relation there so we have to look after families that have lost somebody," Mr Dicker said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "What I've read now is that if you have a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in your family you're at a higher risk of perhaps somebody else in your family (committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ) as well.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's (about) not ignoring \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . (Victims of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ) need to be able to acknowledge that it's happened."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That acknowledgment finally came yesterday when the newly formed Wollongong \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Network launched an information pack containing comprehensive information about pre- and post-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  services and support networks.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The packs will be available via service providers such as mental health organisations, Centrelink and police.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Diet in 2006 enacted a basic law to help prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  And in 2007 the Cabinet adopted the goal of reducing the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 people by 20 percent by 2016 from the level of 2005.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 More than 30,000 people annually have taken their lives for the last 10 consecutive years. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This is about 90 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a day. Japan's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is less than Russia's but the highest among developed countries. It is more than twice that of the United States and more than three times that of Britain.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 1997 was slightly less than 25,000. But 1998 became a turning point, when the number jumped to 32,863. The sharp rise was attributed to an increase in the number of men in their 40s and 50s living in urban areas who, affected by bankruptcies and severe corporate restructuring efforts, committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Even though the overall economic situation has improved, the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has not decreased. The impoverishment of a segment of the population, as indicated by the fact that about one-third of the labor force is irregularly employed, should be considered among the factors contributing to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Prefectural governments have started implementing measures to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  including the creation of networks involving private-sector organizations such as doctor associations and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  hot lines. The National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry has set up a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention center and has placed contact information for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  hot lines on the Internet. Increasing the number of such hot lines and training counseling personnel is important.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Individuals as well as organizations should pay attention to the observation - contained in the government outline of comprehensive measures to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - that people who contemplate \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  send out signals. Families, medical institutions, communities and workplaces should be watchful of people who may be suffering depression and other problems. The government should not only work out measures to help people in this condition but also pursue policies that will bring economic stability to people's lives and give them a hope.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Media reports on inquests should be accompanied by information about where and how to access emotional help, according to a new report on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , published by the Western Health Board.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report produced by the Western Regional Committee on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  also recommends that sensitive matters contained in the pathologist's report should be handed to the coroner at inquests, rather than being read out in open court. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Entitled \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention - a Shared Endeavour, the report asserts that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention is "everybody's business" and can best be brought about through a multidisciplinary approach such as a community-wide programme.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It asserts that research has shown that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates increase following the reporting of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of a prominent person or a celebrity with whom vulnerable people can identify.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The increase depends on the way in which the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is reported and the prominence given to the story.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Portrayal of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in television is also stated to lead to an increase in such behaviour.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Reporting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the media must avoid detailed and explicit information of the method used. All reporting or portrayal of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the media should be accompanied by information about where and how to access help. The Irish Association of Suicidology and the Samaritans have published guidelines on the portrayal of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the media."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In relation to inquests, it is recommended that sensitive matters not be read out in court and that inquests be held on a case- specific basis to avoid distress.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 WELLINGTON -- New Zealand's already high youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate will most likely increase now the drinking age has been lowered, says a visiting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  expert.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Professor Bob Goldey, president of the International Association of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention, said new research from the United States showed youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate was 8 per cent higher in states where the minimum drinking age was 18.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Alcohol increases the risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by deepening depression, negatively affecting the ability to make decisions under stress and interfering with the treatment of mental illness, says the study, which has just been published in the American Journal of Public Health September issue. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Prof Goldey said he, too, believed that lowering the drinking age would affect \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "People talk about marijuana but it's alcohol that's the problem."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Alcohol was behind up to 30 per cent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Alcohol fuelled depression, which Mr Goldey said was the one cause of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that he would rate above all others.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Depression caused up to 40 per cent of youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and up to 80 per cent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in older age groups, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Latest available New Zealand \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  statistics, which are still only provisional, show that 142 people aged between 15 and 24 died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 1997 compared with 143 in 1996 which was the highest youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in the world.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Coroners Council voted unanimously last weekend for the establishment of a national database of death to save the "copious" efforts which had to be made to uncover the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  levels.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Prof Goldey said a national database could potentially provide good research opportunities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "If the database included information like, did this person have a mental disorder, were they in treatment, were they using medication, were they on drugs? -- then you could work out, particularly in conjunction with over-all consequences, how important various factors are for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 New Zealand was in a better position than Australia to develop such a database because of its centralised government system, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At the moment \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  statistics are not published until after coroners have completed investigations meaning that in New Zealand the statistics are often at least two years old when delivered.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Prof Goldey said he saw no reason why provisional statistics could not be delivered month by month.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But while believing New Zealand's youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate could probably be reduced to half of what it is now, Prof Goldey said it was impossible to prevent all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There will always be a certain base rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the community due to mental disorder that you can't do anything about. Everyone wants to blame somebody when someone takes their own life. I don't think we should feel too guilty about it." --NZPA

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  UP to 150 support staff will be employed in schools under a $25 million package in Victoria aimed at curbing Australia's record youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  problem.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The initiatives prompted youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  expert Pierre Baume to say that Victoria was leading the country in its attempts to tackle Australia's high youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Professor Baume, founding director of the Australian Institute for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Research and Prevention, said the funds earmarked by the Victorian government for new youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -prevention measures was greater than that spent by the Federal Government or any State. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  They include $1 million for the establishment of a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Foundation for research, fundraising, education, training and counselling initiatives.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Over 500 Victorians die as a result of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year. For each male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  there are an estimated 30 to 50 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts, and for each female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  there are an estimated 150 to 300 attempts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Professor Baume was a member of the taskforce on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention established by the Victorian Government earlier this year in response to rising \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  levels, particularly among young men.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Victorian statistics broadly reflect national figures, which show that among males aged 15 to 24, the Australian rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has quadrupled since the early 1960s, from 6.8 per 100,000 to 27 per 100,000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In a 1993 UNICEF study of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among young people in 14 industrialised countries, Australia was found to have the highest rate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Professor Baume said the Government had responded to most of the taskforce recommendations, with more resources being given to mental health services, and early intervention and support services.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But he expressed concern that the Government had not established an office of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  research and prevention within government to co-orodinate the efforts of all the different departments.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Premier, Mr Kennett, said the taskforce report had shown there was no one cause of youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and no one solution.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  While it would be difficult to measure the success of the Government's new measures, "as a community, we have to try to do something about the tragedy of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in our society".

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  numbers concern officials," the headline and article on the Oct. 4 Lebanon Daily News front page provided a snapshot of this year's completed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  statistics for Lebanon County.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr. Jeffrey Yocum, Kevin Schrum and Holly Leahy addressed the issue of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Lebanon County. They provided the Lebanon County Commissioners with general information on the 15 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the county this year and talked about some of the work being done to reduce the number of completed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , specifically identifying the efforts of the Lebanon County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Task Force, also known as the TIPS (Training and Information for the Prevention of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ) task force.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The mission of the task force is to develop strategies to reduce the risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and provide education to the community. The task force members represent various county agencies and organizations, as well as members of the community at large. During the last two years the TIPS task force developed and started distributing flyers and palm cards about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . This is a community-wide effort to raise awareness about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , educate the community and promote \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Additionally, in the last year we were able to provide local schools with the "More than Sad" and "Signs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " programs for incorporation into the high-school and middle-school curriculum.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The success of these efforts hinges on the community's involvement. We need everyone to become concerned about the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in Lebanon County and become involved in the effort to reduce the number of county residents ending their lives by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . So how can you help?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Educate yourself about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Learn the warning signs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Be alert to what is going on with the people around you, and be prepared to act.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Learn where to seek help and help others to seek help.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We don't expect you to become an expert on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and/or become a crisis counselor. We want you to be able to recognize when someone around you is having a difficult time and feel comfortable with helping them to seek help to deal with his/her situation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention website, www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .htm, in 2010 there were 38,364 deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , or 12.4 deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 in the U.S. population, approximately 105 deaths per day, and 713,000 emergency department visits for self-inflicted injury.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The 2010 United States Census reports the Lebanon County population at 133,568 and estimates the 2012 population at 135,251. Therefore, based on the national ratio above and Dr. Yocum's statistics for 2013, the Lebanon County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is below the national rate by approximately 1.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the U.S., \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the 10th leading cause of death, an average of one person dies by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every 16.2 minutes, there are four male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for every female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and there are three female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts for each male attempt.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The full impact of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is more difficult to understand and document. It includes self-inflicted injuries, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts, suicidal thoughts and ideations, involvement with mental-health services, and the impact on the families, friends, co-workers and colleagues of the person attempting or completing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to SAVE (\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Awareness Voices of Education), many who attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  never seek professional care; over half of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occur in adult men, ages 25-65; 80 percent of people who seek treatment for depression are treated successfully; 15 percent of those who are clinically depressed die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; there are an estimated eight to 25 attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to one completion; substance abuse is a risk factor for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; the strongest risk factor for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is depression; research has shown medications and therapy to be effective \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention; and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be prevented through education and public awareness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to TIPS, following are the warning signs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 :
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Threatening to hurt or kill self.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Looking for ways to kill self.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Seeking access to pills, guns or other means to harm self.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Talking or writing about death, dying or \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Feeling hopeless.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Experiencing rage, uncontrolled anger or seeking revenge.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Acting reckless or engaging in risky activities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Feeling trapped, like there is no way out.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Increasing alcohol or drug use.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Withdrawing from friends or family.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Having dramatic changes in mood.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Feeling like there is no reason for living, no sense of purpose in life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Sleeping too much or too little.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Most people considering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will exhibit warning signs, but some people will not. Some people will talk directly, and some will talk indirectly about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Fifty to 75 percent of all people who attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  tell someone about their intentions.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Help is available 24/7 through Crisis Intervention at 717-274-3363, or the National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 India records by far the largest number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the world, accounting for nearly a third of the global total and more than twice as many as China, which is second on the list. India also has the highest rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among young people -those aged 15 to 29 years. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These were among the sobering facts revealed in a report released by the WHO, "Preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , A Global Imperative". The report noted that an estimated 8 lakh \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths occurred worldwide in 2012. It is the second leading cause of death in 15-29year-olds.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 India in 2012 recorded nearly 2.6 lakh \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , dwarfing China's 1.2 lakh.Its overall rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  (incidents per lakh population) was 12th at 20.9. The worst countries on this parameter were North and South Korea, Guyana, Lithuania and Sri Lanka. Hungary , Japan, the Russian Federation and Belarus also had higher \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates than India. The Scandina
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 vian countries, Sweden, Norway and Denmark - often perceived as societies with high \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates - had much lower rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In richer countries, three times as many men commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as women, but in low and middle-income countries, the maleto-female ratio is much lower at 1.5 men to each woman.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Globally, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  account for 50% of all violent deaths in men and 71% in women.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In India, the ratio was about 1.6 with close to 1.6 lakh men committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2012 compared to just under 1 lakh women. In four countries in India's immediate neighbourhood -China, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan -women outnumbered men among \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Only in Iraq and Indonesia was the proportion of women to men among those committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  higher than these countries.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 India, despite its horrific statistics, has actually seen a decline in the tendency to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  since 2012, with the rate declining by 9.2% over this 12-year period.China, in the same period, saw its \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate drop by 59%.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 India is a clear exception to the global pattern of the 70+ age group having the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates. At 21.1 per lakh population, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among this age group are only about as common as among the entire population. Risk factors associated with the health system and society at large include difficulties in accessing health care and in receiving the care needed, easy availability of the means for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , inappropriate media reporting that sensationalizes \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and increases the risk of "copycat" \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and stigma against people who seek help for suicidal behaviours, or for mental health and substance abuse problems.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Three hundred and three people died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Northern Ireland last year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What a shocking and shameful indictment of our society. I have seen behind the statistics. I have journeyed alongside mothers who lost a son to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fathers who lost a son to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  women and men who lost brothers to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Despite their huge losses they live their lives with the hope that things will be different for those of us still alive. I salute their courage and generosity of spirit. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It has been said that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention is everyone's business. I think it is time to change this hackneyed phrase to a bolder more meaningful one. I believe that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention is everyone's responsibility.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  recognises no borders or boundaries. It slices across every part and piece of all of our society, all of our people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 My plea is to join together and shift our thinking away from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention towards the elimination of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in our society. The aim would be to look beyond 'an acceptable level of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide'\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  towards zero \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jan. 03--More Weld County residents died of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2013 than ever before, county health officials reported Thursday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Weld County's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  death toll in 2013 was 49, well above the county's 10-year average of 32 per year. About 200 county residents are hospitalized each year for intentional injury, officials reported.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is one of the most persistent yet preventable public health problems. It's the leading cause of death from injuries, more than car crashes," said Mark Wallace, executive director of the Weld County Department of Public Health and Environment. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Currently, 80 percent of Weld \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are by males and nearly 50 percent involve firearms.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Males ages 45-64 have the highest rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Weld County, officials said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There were 14 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Weld County among that group in 2012 and 24 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among that group in 2013.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 County officials could not say Thursday why the total number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  climbed so high in 2013.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I can't identify why there was a spike in 2013," said Kelly Campbell, the department's health communication, education and planning supervisor. "There is no clear reason why the numbers are up this year."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said the total number might be higher because more people moved into the county but she said the per capita rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for 2013 can't be figured yet until the state gives the county official population numbers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Other local experts could not pinpoint the cause Thursday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There are likely many reasons for the county's rising \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate," said Kimberly Pratt, North Range Behavioral Health \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  educator and clinician. "The single most identifiable risk factor associated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is depression."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Campbell said the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in Weld County was 16.3 per 100,000 people in 2010 and declined to 15.2 per 100,000 people in 2012.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said of the 2013 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Weld, none involved children under 10; four were 10-19 years old; six were 20-29 years old; 12 were 30-39 years old; 12 were 40-49 years old; eight were 50-59 years old; and seven were more than 60 years old.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Campbell said there is a common misconception that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occurs more often around the holidays and during the winter because the weather can be depressing.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has long been a concern of parents of high school students everywhere and the same is true here in Weld.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the 2010 Healthy Kids Colorado Survey for Weld County, 17 percent of high school students seriously considered attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and 12 percent of students made a plan how they would do it.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be prevented, officials said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention resources include North Range Behavioral Health's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Education and Support Services.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SESS provides community education in high schools, businesses, faith-based organizations and the community at large.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The state Office of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention leads Colorado's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention and intervention efforts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Two state initiatives are underway. ManTherapy.org is an online resource using "manspeak" and humor to target men at risk for depression and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and Means Restriction Education is a program that educates Coloradans on the importance of reducing suicidal individuals' access to lethal means are promising.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to experts, people who say they plan to kill themselves and have the means are at the highest risk and should be taken seriously.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Taking the initiative to engage in conversation with those people in a way that is nonjudgmental and compassionate is crucial, as is recommending they seek professional help, experts say.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  numbers concern officials," the headline and article on the Oct. 4 Lebanon Daily News front page provided a snapshot of this year's completed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  statistics for Lebanon County.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr. Jeffrey Yocum, Kevin Schrum and Holly Leahy addressed the issue of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Lebanon County. They provided the Lebanon County Commissioners with general information on the 15 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the county this year and talked about some of the work being done to reduce the number of completed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , specifically identifying the efforts of the Lebanon County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Task Force, also known as the TIPS (Training and Information for the Prevention of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ) task force.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The mission of the task force is to develop strategies to reduce the risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and provide education to the community. The task force members represent various county agencies and organizations, as well as members of the community at large. During the last two years the TIPS task force developed and started distributing flyers and palm cards about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . This is a community-wide effort to raise awareness about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , educate the community and promote \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Additionally, in the last year we were able to provide local schools with the "More than Sad" and "Signs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " programs for incorporation into the high-school and middle-school curriculum.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The success of these efforts hinges on the community's involvement. We need everyone to become concerned about the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in Lebanon County and become involved in the effort to reduce the number of county residents ending their lives by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . So how can you help?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Educate yourself about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Learn the warning signs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Be alert to what is going on with the people around you, and be prepared to act.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Learn where to seek help and help others to seek help.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We don't expect you to become an expert on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and/or become a crisis counselor. We want you to be able to recognize when someone around you is having a difficult time and feel comfortable with helping them to seek help to deal with his/her situation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention website, www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .htm, in 2010 there were 38,364 deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , or 12.4 deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 in the U.S. population, approximately 105 deaths per day, and 713,000 emergency department visits for self-inflicted injury.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The 2010 United States Census reports the Lebanon County population at 133,568 and estimates the 2012 population at 135,251. Therefore, based on the national ratio above and Dr. Yocum's statistics for 2013, the Lebanon County \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is below the national rate by approximately 1.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the U.S., \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the 10th leading cause of death, an average of one person dies by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every 16.2 minutes, there are four male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for every female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and there are three female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts for each male attempt.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The full impact of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is more difficult to understand and document. It includes self-inflicted injuries, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts, suicidal thoughts and ideations, involvement with mental-health services, and the impact on the families, friends, co-workers and colleagues of the person attempting or completing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to SAVE (\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Awareness Voices of Education), many who attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  never seek professional care; over half of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occur in adult men, ages 25-65; 80 percent of people who seek treatment for depression are treated successfully; 15 percent of those who are clinically depressed die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; there are an estimated eight to 25 attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to one completion; substance abuse is a risk factor for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; the strongest risk factor for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is depression; research has shown medications and therapy to be effective \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention; and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be prevented through education and public awareness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to TIPS, following are the warning signs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 :
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Threatening to hurt or kill self.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Looking for ways to kill self.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Seeking access to pills, guns or other means to harm self.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Talking or writing about death, dying or \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Feeling hopeless.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Experiencing rage, uncontrolled anger or seeking revenge.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Acting reckless or engaging in risky activities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Feeling trapped, like there is no way out.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Increasing alcohol or drug use.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Withdrawing from friends or family.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Having dramatic changes in mood.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Feeling like there is no reason for living, no sense of purpose in life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Sleeping too much or too little.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Most people considering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will exhibit warning signs, but some people will not. Some people will talk directly, and some will talk indirectly about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Fifty to 75 percent of all people who attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  tell someone about their intentions.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The drop in Maori \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was largely accounted for by a decrease in male Maori \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , in particular young male Maori \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . In 2011-12 there were 94 male Maori \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , while in 2012-13 there were 72.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 --------------------
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Loneliness and isolation could be the leading factors in the high \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate for elderly men, according to Age Concern Horowhenua.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The annual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  figures, made public by chief coroner Judge Neil MacLean yesterday, showed men aged 85 years and older are killing themselves at a higher rate than any other age group.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nine men and three women over 85 years took their own lives in the year to June.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Age Concern Horowhenua manager Anna Auty said isolation was "a huge issue for older people, particularly in the Horowhenua area where there is no public transport".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We've got a very high proportion of older people here and a lot of people choose to come here to retire.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's fine when you've got your health but when you get ill and if your partner dies, life changes enormously."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ms Auty said older people did not want to be a nuisance and would "bottle it up".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Judge MacLean said there needed to be more research into \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among elderly people and the line between euthanasia and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There were 47 self-inflicted deaths across all age groups in the Palmerston North coronial region, and a total of 541 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  across the country.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There were six fewer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than last year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Judge MacLean said the annual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  total had been stubbornly consistent since records began in July 2007, with between 531 and 558 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Sadly this year is no different and it is frustrating that we cannot seem to make inroads into our unacceptably high \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate," he said. "In spite of this, there have been some positive trends observed in the year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Maori \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has dropped for the first time since records began, and the number of pre-teen and teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is down from last year."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The number of Maori who killed themselves in the year to June dropped to 105 after spiking to 132 the previous year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 MidCentral Health Mental Health Services clinical director Jerry Varghese said it could be that intervention methods were working.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We can't say with certainty what the exact reasons are for the decrease - one would hope the various interventions put in place for Maori health in general could potentially have had a positive impact," he said. "If I was to look at my list, the one thing that stands out for me is the bulk are male, but also Caucasian."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 CHENNAI: The number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Tamil Nadu has gone up by 6%, the latest report of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) shows.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Statistics say that the state continues to be the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  capital of the country with 16,927 people killing themselves, which comes to an average of 48 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases a day in 2012. In 2011, the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases in the state was 15,963. Other states topping the list are Maharashtra (16,112), West Bengal (14,957) and Andhra Pradesh (14,238). 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 NCRB, which is the only document in India that provides statistics about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , shows that 1,35,445 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases were reported in 2012 across the country. This is marginally lower than 2011 when the number was 1,35,585. Experts say that the reasons for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  include unemployment, exam failure, poverty and dowry disputes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Chennai also records the most number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among the cities with 2,183 cases, an average of five a day in 2012. Bangalore comes in next (1,989), followed by Delhi (1,397) and Mumbai (1,296). But the figures also show that there has been a 10% dip in the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Chennai compared to the previous year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Experts say that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is more of a mental health problem than a social issue. Men usually commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  because of professional pressure, drug or alcohol addiction and depression, while women's reasons include family conflicts or heartbreak. The elderly commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  due to loneliness, terminal diseases or family feuds.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Lakshmi Vijayakumar, founder of Sneha, a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention helpline (044-24640050), said that family problems are the main reason behind \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the southern states. "The exact number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases is 25% higher than what is reported in the NCRB. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is underreported," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Restriction of access to poison and alcohol could reduce the numbers, she said. "The government should provide adequate training to primary health centre staff in rural areas and enable them to suicidal tendencies," she said. Sneha receives up to 20 phone calls and 25 emails every day.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Records say 73.5% \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims from the state are married. Widows and widowers account for 3.6%, while divorcees are only 0.7%. The data shows that the most frequently used methods are hanging (31.9%), consuming poison (31.4%) and self-immolation (13.9%).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The number of male victims (10,748) outnumbers the female (6,179). The maximum number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was reported in the age of 30-44 years (33%), followed by 15-29 years (31.4%). Going by profession, homemakers (17%) form the largest group. The rate is low among the people working in government (1.7%) and public sector undertakings (1.5%).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I have been hearing about more and more cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  lately. Some are related to the recession, some to more traditional triggers such as depression and some have come out of the blue.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One of the conclusions I have come to is that it is impossible to make any statement about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that holds true for all cases. For instance, some people seem to withdraw before they take their lives but others have been fully engaged with friends and family before the dreadful event.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It seems to me that the only statements we can make about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  begin with the word "sometimes". Here is my list:  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sometimes \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is impulsive. We can be fairly sure of this from US research showing that sometimes the decision and the act of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are separated by minutes, not hours. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This, of course, is exacerbated by the gun culture in the US but here in Ireland we sometimes hear of people taking their lives apparently impulsively. This, it seems to me, is one of the most frightening aspects of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sometimes people who die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are ambivalent about taking their lives. Why else do people (thankfully) ring up helplines before they act? And why have many people interrupted in the act gone on to live full lives?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Inexplicable actionSometimes \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is completely inexplicable. We hear of these \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  all the time: people who have everything going for them, who seem to be in fine form and who go and take their lives to the utter dismay of all around them. I suspect a concealed depression or despair in many of these cases but I cannot know.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sometimes \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is motivated by shame. This has been suggested (by a psychiatrist who treated army veterans) as an explanation for the shocking levels of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among US veterans. But I suspect this is also at work in some of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that arose from our own economic catastrophe.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sometimes \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  seems the only way out. What seems to happen here is that a person gradually rejects every solution to their problems except \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The conclusion that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the only way out is irrational. This is obvious to outsiders but not to the person who is trapped in this blinkered thinking.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sometimes people who take their own lives also have a longing for life. This also is why many people heading towards \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will, nonetheless, engage with counsellors, helplines and relatives or friends. It is also why acknowledging people's suicidal intentions, by explicitly asking them if they are suicidal, can be very helpful and effective.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sometimes people just can't face what the future holds. I suspect this is often behind the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of older people afflicted by bereavement, loneliness or pain.Meticulous planningSometimes \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is meticulously planned. Many people think about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but it is those who actively plan their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  who are at huge risk. That is why it is a good idea to ask a person who is talking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  if they have made plans. If the answer is 'Yes', the situation is very serious.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sometimes \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  spreads like a virus. We have all heard of clusters of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that were never reported in the media. It is truly frightening that knowledge of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of others whom one has never met, in some cases, can lead to the taking of one's own life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sometimes the culture increases the likelihood of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Is it a coincidence that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has risen as concepts such as solidarity and community have been pushed back by rampant individualism, for example, I'm alright Jack, I've got my iPod here to connect with and I don't need you? What does the Traveller culture, especially the taboo on admitting to and discussing mental health problems, contribute to the high rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in that culture?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What is the use of all this? Perhaps if we are to get to grips with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , we need to acknowledge that this sad and lonely act can have many explanations. And, sometimes, no explanation at all.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 An analysis of deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  officially recorded between 2009 and 2011 also shows \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in Laois and Westmeath and the South-East, including Wexford, Waterford, and Tipperary, above average. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Some of the lowest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in the country are found in several parts of Dublin.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Government was accused of not taking \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  seriously last month after it emerged the key post of director at the National Office for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention remains unfilled more than a year after the resignation of Geoff Day.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to statistics compiled by the CSO, 1,563 people in the Republic took their own lives between 2009 and 2011, a national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate of 11.4 deaths per 100,000 population. In contrast, a total of 636 people were killed in traffic accidents over the same period.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While there has been a strong downward trend in road fatalities over the past decade, the number of deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has shown an increase since 2007, so that they are now at almost two-and-a-half times the level of road fatalities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Official figures show there were 552 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2009, falling to 486 in 2010 and rising again to 525 last year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kerry has the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in the country with 80 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the past three years, equating to an annual rate of 18.3 deaths per 100,000 people. It is almost three times higher than the area with the lowest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate - Fingal in north Dublin, which has a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate of 6.2 deaths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Offaly had the second highest rate with 41 deaths, equating to an annual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate of 17.8 deaths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sixty-one deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were recorded in Cork City over the three-year period giving a rate of 17.1 deaths per 100,000 population - the third highest in the Republic. However, the total of 26 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the city in 2009 was halved by 2011 when the number of deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  decreased to 13 - a rate which would push Cork City below the national average.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There were 149 cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Co Cork (excluding the city area) between 2009 and 2011 - a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate of 12.4%.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On a provincial basis, Munster has the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate at 13.8 deaths followed by Connacht (11.9), Leinster (10.2) and Ulster (9.5). Galway and Dublin have the lowest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate of all the major cities at 8.4 deaths, although the figure rises to 10.6 per 100,000 population in the Dublin City Council area. A total of 319 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were recorded in the capital over the three-year period.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Asked by Fianna F\'e1il's health spokesman, Billy Kelleher, earlier this week to respond to criticism by the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention agency, Turn the Tide of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , that the Government had failed to tackle the problem, junior health minister Kathleen Lynch, said she recently held a "very open and frank" meeting with the charity.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said a special allocation of  35m was provided for mental health services this year, primarily to strengthen community mental health teams and to implement Reach Out, the State strategy for action on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It is widely accepted that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a complex issue and that there's no easy or single intervention that will bring a guarantee of success," said Ms Lynch.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the last ten years of Narendra Modi's tenure as Gujarat chief minister, an average of ten persons committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per day in the state, figures released by the Gujarat Congress on Tuesday show. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The figures, collected under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, show that 37,248 persons committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Gujarat between 2001 and 2010, which works out to an average of ten \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per day.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Of the total 37,248 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , 21,783 were by males and 15,423 by females, figures which belie the common notion that more women commit
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  compared to the opposite sex.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The figures also reveal some shocking and disturbing trends.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Of the total persons who committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , 80% were by persons under the age of 40. Every fifth person committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was under 20, while persons in the age group of 21 to 30 accounted for 37% of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The figures show that more than 71% of the persons committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were married.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Gujarat Congress president Arjun Modhwadia said that the Modi government is wooing the youths ahead of elections, but figures show that a large majority of the persons committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are youth.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has increased due to lack of attention and negligence of the administration," Modhwadia alleged.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sociologist Dr Vidyut Joshi said the data shows that fabric of the society has been considerably weakened, and we are now living in a disturbed society.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The figures show that 7,062 farmers also ended their lives in the state under Modi's rule. Modhwadia alleged that more farmers have committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Gujarat, than in Andhra Pradesh and Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, which are infamous for farmer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and are co-incidently Congress-ruled state.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Saurashtra and north Gujarat together accounted for more than 70% of the total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sociologist Dr Gaurang Jani said that large number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the two regions could be attributed to water scarcity, while Dr Edvin Masihi called for steps to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ONE in 10 of all teenage deaths are due to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , as highlighted in Teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Week, held last week. 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a reality for many families with 9.5% of all teen deaths in South Africa due to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  according to the National Youth Risk Survey. In addition, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the fastest growing, and second leading, cause of death in the 15 to 24 age group. The survey found an alarming number of high school teens were depressed and suicidal - more than 20% had considered \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the last month. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  "But despite its prevalence, teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is still shrouded in myth and misconception. It's crucial we break the myths - there is no better way to prevent teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," said a spokesman for the South African Depression and Anxiety Group (Sadag).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  Sadag runs the only toll-free \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  crisis line in the country and the only teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention programme in schools. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  The "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Shouldn't be a Secret" programme, now 11 years old, is aimed at educating teens and teachers about the warning signs, facts and interventions of teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  Children as young as seven years old commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in South Africa. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  "My friend used to always tell me she wanted to die, and that she was going to kill herself. I never took her seriously until she hung herself," Sadag reports Naomi, 14, as saying. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  Its programme has been implemented in schools across the country. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  "Through presenting to teens, teachers, parents and police about the trauma of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  we are able to prevent the loss of lives," said the spokesman.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Charleville \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Awareness Project, whose mission is "to educate, inform and support the community on the issue of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ", has been focused on creating greater awareness of the supports available to the public to help promote better and more positive mental health.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Over the past number of years, as well as facilitating a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -bereaved support group, the project has facilitated a number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  awareness training programmes such as safetalk, Asist-applied \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Intervention Skills Training, and Peer Support Education. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The safetalk programme is a free, three-hour introductory version of ASIST (Applied \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Intervention Skills Training) and it aims to increase awareness of self-harm and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Most persons with thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  go unrecognised   even though most are, directly or indirectly, requesting help. By attending this course, participants will be in a better position to identify people who have thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 With more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -alert helpers in the community, more people with thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will get connected to the help they want. The safetalk programme is the result of over 20 years of work at learning how to develop useful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention abilities in a short programme and is fully supported by the HSE. It is recommended that the safetalk course is undertaken as a prior requirement to availing of the ASIST programme. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This course is free and places are limited to 30 places so participants are encouraged to book early to avoid disappointment. Contact Margaret O'callaghan on 0863576109 in confidence for further information and to register your interest. participants will be advised in due course of date, time and venue of the course. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Charleville \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Awareness Project is supported locally by the HSE'S Turas Nua Mental Health Resource Centre and by Ballyhoura Development Ltd. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If you are feeling at risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , contact the 1Life 24-hour \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Helpline on tel. 1800 247 100, and consult with your local GP.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When I was 16, my father took his own life. This was the first time I experienced the mourning of a death to someone so close to me. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To make matters more difficult, it was a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , something I knew nothing about. When I entered my high school after this event, it was rarely
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 spoken about. I felt that no one had a grasp on understanding \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I am now 19 and have heard of more deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in our community and surrounding areas.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I have come to realize depression and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are common occurrences and, yet, I still feel as if it is not being spoken about.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The topic of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  should not be taboo. We can't conceal it and pretend it doesn't happen. The World Health Organization estimates that each year approximately one million people die from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , which is one death every 40 seconds.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is happening all around us, even among youth who some might think are too young to consider \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . We have schools every single
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 day where there's a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , yet they don't
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 respond at all.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Many school administrators don't want to talk about it and silence discussion of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . That's a really big problem.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I believe the topic of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention needs to be developed in schools. This
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 includes not just colleges and universities, but in high schools as well. For most, it will be the first time they will talk about it and they may have no clue anyone else felt the same feelings of hopelessness they do. The people who are mourning a loss through \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be provided with guidance and support, too.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 People need to know they are not alone in their feelings of sadness, pain and hopelessness. People need to know there is hope and there is help. We were never meant to do life alone. People need other people. Community, hope and help need to replace secrets and silence.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 AMMAN - Many obstacles stand in the way of accurately determining the prevalence of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Jordan, a forensics expert said on Wednesday.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 The Kingdom registered 25 to 30 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the first six months of the year, according to National Institute of Forensic Medicine (NIFM) figures.   
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Last year, 65 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and 400 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts were registered, an 8.3 per cent increase compared to 2008, when the figures stood at 60 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and 400 attempts.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 The actual number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , however, might be higher, according to NIFM Director Momen Hadidi, who blamed the lack of accurate figures on the absence of a data collection system, scattered efforts by concerned parties, and unwillingness among victims' families to admit the causes of their relatives' deaths.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 "Numbers provided by different concerned parties conflict, as we do not have a national data registry for confirmed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," he said, adding that social taboos associated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  often compel families to mask their loved ones' \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as accidental deaths.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Another reason for the lack of accurate data, he noted, is that even forensics specialists sometimes find it difficult to determine the cause of a person's death.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 "Sometimes, as in burn-related deaths, it is difficult to judge whether the death is a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , a homicide or accidental," Hadidi said, noting that in such cases, the death is only considered a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  if the victim leaves a note saying he or she intends to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 The most common methods of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are hanging, poisoning and jumping from tall buildings, he said, adding that the institute stopped recording \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts this year.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 "It is difficult to decide if an incident is a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt unless it takes place in public, as jumping attempts," Hadidi explained, pointing out that there is no law in place requiring hospitals that receive survivors of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts to report them.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 He also noted that the law does not criminalise \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or prescribe any punishment for those who attempt to kill themselves, although religious experts stress that the act is forbidden in both Islam and Christianity.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 "Any incident that leads to hurting oneself and the body is prohibited in Islam, and a judge can take appropriate measures against those who attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," Abdul Nasser Abul Bassal, president of the International Islamic University in Jordan, told The Jordan Times.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 According to Father Rifaat Bader, spokesman for the Roman Catholic Church in Jordan, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is also prohibited in Christianity.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Both Abul Bassal and Bader said it is important to reach out those who attempt to kill themselves and provide them with social and psychological support.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 "These people should not be left without help[#x629] the church provides people with the counselling they need and we try to give them hope in their lives," Bader told The Jordan Times.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate among older Australians has declined over the past decade.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For women aged 45 to 75 the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate has almost halved since 1982, while the drop in the rate for men over 55 has been less dramatic but still significant. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The research manager of the Australian Institute of Family Studies, Dr David de Vaus, said there was little research into \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among older people, so it was unclear why the rates were dropping.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, he wrote in the institute's journal Family Matters: "The declining rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among older men is an important change and deserves further investigation for what it may teach us about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among younger groups".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr de Vaus's study into \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was prompted by concern about the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate among young people but he concluded that there had been an increased \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate overall among men (up to the age of 54).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It remains the case that the age groups most prone to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  remains males aged 25-34 and 75 and over. The increase in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate for young males should not overshadow the continuing high rates among other age groups".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr de Vaus also said Australia was not alone in having a high \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate among young men - New Zealand, Norway, Britain, Spain and the Netherlands were experiencing similar increases.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was clearly not a randomly distributed event because of the link between \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and race (it is higher among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth), location (it is higher among rural men), gender (the rate is eight times higher for men aged 15-24 than for women of the same age), employment status and mental health.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The community had to "consider ways in which we provide opportunities for young people and others to develop a sense of belonging", he said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 An apparently sudden increase in the level of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among Aborigines has alarmed black communities in Australia, an eminent sociologist, Professor Colin Tatz, has found after a study. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Professor Tatz identified 35 attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and four \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  over the seven-month period in which he visited 78 Aboriginal communities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is the first attempt to gather national statistics indicating the level of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by Aborigines outside police or prison custody.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The results tend to undermine an often-stated Aboriginal view that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are linked to jails.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Every person I spoke to - whether Aboriginal community councillors, nurses, education aides, police or the elders - said they had never known a time when violence, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had been so high," Professor Tatz said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The professor, who was commissioned to undertake the study by the Australian Council of Criminologists, said he had been able to identify only 20 cases of self-destructive behaviour or \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in all anthropological studies published up to 1960.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the 30 years since, there had been 25 cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the Kimberley area alone, he said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Professor Tatz's study showed that between October 16 and 29 last year, eight Aborigines attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , outside custody, in the Adelaide area, which has an estimated Aboriginal population of 1,500.

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 The International Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention (IASP) and the World Health Organization are co-sponsoring World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day on September 10th. Events are being held on every continent.
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 The International Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention (IASP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) co-sponsor World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day every year on September 10th. This year's observances will include: an education seminar, in Bangalore, India; an Inuit Celebration of life ceremony on Parliament Hill, Canada; workshops for volunteers in Malaysia; countless walks in Australia and America; and thousands of lanterns being released in Ireland.
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about one million people die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every year; this represents a "global" mortality rate of 16 per 100,000, or one death every 40 seconds, or about 3,000 deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  daily. For every person who dies by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , 20 or more attempt to end their lives.
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 IASP President, Dr. Lanny Berman, states, "On World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, September 10, 2011, the theme "Preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Multicultural Societies" will be embraced. As we develop and implement national and local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  intervention strategies we need to be aware of cultural factors that can impact on suicidal behaviour in diverse settings".
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Dr. Berman continues, "We have seen positive outcomes from our tailored approaches to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention. For example, the restriction of the sale of charcoal in supermarket chains in Hong Kong has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by poisoning from charcoal burning, and a concerted community response to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention at a district level shows a positive impact on rates of deliberate self-harm and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ."
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 "In addition," he states, "We now have good evidence that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates are reduced substantially when leaders make preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a central focus for their entire systems, such as in the US Air Force. We also know that significant reductions in rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts have been found when programs aimed at improving recognition and care of depression are implemented."
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 "In Australia, stricter firearm legislation coincided with a significant reduction in the number of firearm \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and, in England, restricted access through altered packaging of over-the-counter- medicines resulted in a reduction in the number of deaths by intentional overdose."
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 "These few examples demonstrate that if we take into account cultural elements, we can make great strides in the advancement of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, understanding and practice."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 WHEN OREGON legalized assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 1994, Ron Wyden claimed to oppose allowing doctors to prescribe drugs for terminally ill patients to use in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0   Now a Democratic senator from Oregon, Wyden has a chance to prove he meant what he said by supporting the Pain Relief Promotion Act, expected to come before the Senate any day.  Instead, in his vocal and emotional opposition to the bill, Wyden may be showing his true colors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Pain Relief Promotion Act is intended to encourage the legitimate use of painkilling drugs -- and deter their use in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0   The treatment of pain is an area of acute medical underachievement, partly, some say, because doctors fear prosecution under the Controlled Substances Act if they overprescribe narcotics.  The Pain Relief Promotion Act states explicitly for the first time that alleviating pain is a legitimate use of controlled substances, even when it "may increase the risk of death." And the bill would provide funds to educate doctors in pain control.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But the legislation would do something else as well.  It would restore the uniform application of the Controlled Substances Act, undoing the partial exemption attorney general Janet Reno extended to Oregon to accommodate its assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  law.  Doctors in Oregon, as in the other 49 states, who give patients controlled substances for the purpose of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  could lose their federal license to prescribe such drugs or even suffer criminal sanctions.  In effect, the Pain Relief Promotion Act would end Oregon's nullification of a federal statute.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is on this ground that Ron Wyden vows a filibuster.  He is outraged, he says, that the legislation would interfere with "states' rights" -- though he also maintains, bizarrely, that a bill intended to encourage pain relief would have a "chilling effect" on doctors' willingness to provide that very thing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Senator Wyden doth protest too much.  The Pain Relief Promotion Act would advance, not interfere with, the proper medical treatment of pain.  That is why the American Medical Association, the National Hospice Organization, and many other medical groups enthusiastically support it.  Experience in states like Rhode Island and Louisiana, moreover, shows that it is possible simultaneously to outlaw assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and promote aggressive pain control: After relevant laws went into effect in those states, doctors' use of morphine to treat pain skyrocketed.  Nor does the federal bill impinge in the least on states' rights.  As the (Portland) \b0 \i \ul0 Oregonian\b0 \i0 \ul0  editorialized, it is actually the Oregon law that "barges into an area of long-standing federal jurisdiction," and not the other way around.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Wyden's arguments, then, are off base, and his attempt to have it both ways with his constituents -- to oppose assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  personally while supporting the state's right to legalize it -- looks like posturing.  Sure enough, it turns out that one of Wyden's chief advisers in the fight against the Pain Relief Promotion Act is one James L. Werth, a Congressional Fellow working in Wyden's office.  Werth, who has a Ph.D. in counseling psychology, is a national leader of the movement for "rational \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 "
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Under the theory of rational \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  mental health professionals do not have an unequivocal duty to prevent their patients from killing themselves.  The only \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  they must stop are those that are impulsive or frivolous.  If a mental health professional deems a patient to have a rational basis for wanting to die, the professional's primary duty shifts from preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to ensuring that the patient thinks through the decision carefully.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Here is how rational \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  would work.  If a patient expressed a desire to die, his mental health worker would nonjudgmentally help him use proper decision-making techniques to sort out whether or not "to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " If the pros were perceived to substantially outweigh the cons, the mental health professional would stand back and refrain from impeding the patient's self-destruction (although some rational \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  advocates believe the better response would be to help the patient die).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mental health workers, in their professional associations and literature and symposia, are still debating the criteria for rational \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but a rough consensus has been crafted.  Werth, in his book \b0 \i \ul0 Rational \b0 \i0 \ul0 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \b \i \ul0 Suicide?\b \i0 \ul0 \cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 \b0 \i \ul0   Implications for Mental Health Professionals,\b0 \i0 \ul0  recommends a five-step approach for determining whether the patient's decision-making process is "sound." He also asserts that people should be allowed to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  if they have a "hopeless condition," which he defines as including, but "not necessarily limited to, terminal illnesses, severe physical and/or psychological pain, physically or mentally debilitating and/or deteriorating conditions, or quality of life no longer acceptable to the individual."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Consider this definition closely: All suicidal people have severe psychological pain or mentally debilitating conditions.  Every suicidal person \b0 \i \ul0 by definition\b0 \i0 \ul0  believes that his quality of life is unacceptable.  In the name of nonjudgmentalism, rational \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  transforms self-destruction into just another choice.  It is also a warrant for the abandonment of suicidal sufferers by psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers, the very people who are often the last line of defense between a despairing person and a leap into eternity.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The rational \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  movements are close allies in the struggle to make killing an accepted medical practice.  Thus, it is not surprising that James Werth is also hip deep in the assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  movement.  He will be a featured speaker at the biennial convention of the World Federation of Right to Die Societies in Boston this fall, alongside Hemlock Society founder Derek Humphry, co-author of the Oregon assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  law Barbara Coombs Lee, and the "Australian Kevorkian," Dr. Philip Nitschke, whose first \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  machine was just purchased for display by London's Science Museum.  Werth's \b0 \i \ul0 curriculum vitae\b0 \i0 \ul0  lists among his "hastened-death-related activities" his service on the board of directors of the Nebraska Hemlock Society, ending in July 1999, and his recent service on the board of the Death With Dignity National Center, two organizations that advocate assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0   He also helped coordinate an amicus brief in the United States Supreme Court in the 1997 case of \b0 \i \ul0 Washington\b0 \i0 \ul0  v. \b0 \i \ul0 Glucksberg,\b0 \i0 \ul0  which, had it been heeded, would have produced the assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  \b0 \i \ul0 Roe\b0 \i0 \ul0  v. \b0 \i \ul0 Wade.\b0 \i0 \ul0  So much for states' rights.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is a terrible irony in all of this.  Last July, with Tipper Gore at his side, surgeon general David Satcher issued "a call to action" against \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0   In an alarming report, Satcher warned that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  the country's eighth leading cause of death, is one of our most pressing public health concerns.  Approximately 31,000 Americans die at their own hands each year, far more than the 20,000 who are murdered.  Between 1952 and 1996, the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among adolescents and young adults tripled.  More teenagers and young adults die from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than from cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, stroke, pneumonia, influenza, and chronic lung disease combined.  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  strikes older Americans particularly hard.  On average, 18 older Americans kill themselves each day, with the rate highest among white males aged 65 and older.  But how is Dr. Satcher to mount an effective anti-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  campaign when mental health professionals and high public officials send mixed signals about preventing self-killing?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Those fighting the Pain Relief Promotion Act deny that their opposition is based on any support for assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0   That is hard to believe.  The fact that Sen. Wyden, the leader of the effort to defeat the bill, is working hand in glove with such a big shot in the rational \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  movements strongly suggests that the opposition actually cares little about states' rights or chilling effects.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The devastating news of youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and an alarming increase and string of deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  this year have turned a typically private situation into front-page news.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Most Oklahomans know someone who died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Oklahoma ranks 12th in the nation in deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , which is the second-leading cause of death for Oklahoma youth ages 10-24. In HeartLine's Healthy Education for Life Program, which is free for schools, 25 percent of students are self-identifying as at-risk for depression or \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Further, most young people who die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  tell someone or provide warning signs before attempting it. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the most preventable form of death, and education is the key to prevention. So why are we afraid to talk about it?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Bringing prevention education to schools isn't easy. Administrators struggle with the stigma of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Much like the previous notion of sex education, the belief is that if we talk about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , we will "give students the idea" or cause them to attempt it. Among their other fears is the perception that parents will hold the school accountable if a child dies by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  after they get prevention training.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Talking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  neither causes it nor gives someone the idea. It allows a difficult topic to be discussed and an opportunity for people who are hurting to reach out for help. We know that callers to Oklahoma's 1-800-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 SUICIDE\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and 1-800-273-TALK help lines are at a decreased risk for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  after talking to a crisis specialist.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  School officials also express concern for liability if a student dies by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Legally, schools can't be held liable for a student's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by providing prevention education. In fact, it would speak well of the school to show that it had provided \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention education versus not addressing the topic at all. School officials who adopt this training can feel confident that they've given students information and support.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Administrators often hold onto these fears until they lose a student to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . This tragic loss makes the issue of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  all too real to them, the parents and community; the need to address the topic with students is then realized. Why do we react in the aftermath of a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , or multiple \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but fail to take the necessary steps to prevent the loss of life beforehand?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Some school districts, such as Norman, have been advocates for prevention education for years. Progress is being made in Edmond because Susan Parks, public information officer of Edmond Public Schools, is pushing for preventive measures. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention programs should be required across the state. Schools should see the value in prevention education that teaches students how to identify \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  warning signs, how to get help personally or for a friend, and directs them to appropriate resources.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Let's not wait for the next young person to die before we require schools to educate students on the warning signs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and how to get help.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 risk factors for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 : * Depression and other mental disorders, or a substance-abuse disorder (often in combination with other mental disorders). More than 90 percent of people who die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have these risk factors. * A prior \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt. * Family history of mental disorder or substance abuse.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Family history of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . * Family violence, including physical or sexual abuse. * Firearms in the home. Firearms are used in more than half of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . * Incarceration. * Exposure to the suicidal behavior of others, such as family members, peers or media figures. The National Institute of Mental Health As many as 25 attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occur for every \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  death, and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  claims about 33,000 lives per year. "There are a lot of people hurting out there, for a lot of various reasons," said Pat Flynn, a licensed clinical social worker and practicing psychotherapist with WKM Psychology Clinics in Platteville, Wis., and in private practice in Dubuque. Flynn calls \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "a life needlessly lost." "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is preventable," he said. "We need to listen, observe more carefully and educate ourselves about symptoms." The week beginning Sunday, Sept. 6, is National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Week. "Especially during this week, we need to recognize \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as one of life's most tragic events," Flynn said. "Take threats of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  seriously. If you start at that point and then take a look at what's happening in a person's life, certainly there are obvious signals and signs. The people in that situation are so desperate." Flynn advises that people watch for symptoms and warning signs in their friends and family members. Such signs can include threatening to hurt or kill oneself; withdrawing from friends, family and society; dramatic mood changes; talking or writing about death, dying or \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; and increased alcohol or drug use. "In over 70 percent of completed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , alcohol or drugs are involved," Flynn said, "and often there is a precipitating, traumatic event within the month preceding." Overall the 11th leading cause of death in America, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the third-leading cause of death for young people ages 15 to 24. "Try to communicate with the person (at risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 )," said Todd Lange, of the National Alliance on Mental Illness-Dubuque. "Sometimes people are worried about mentioning the idea, but if you deal with it directly, that can lead to some breakthroughs in communication." \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  also strikes older adults disproportionately, with 14.2 of every 100,000 persons age 65 and older dying by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , compared to the average of 10.9 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 people in the general population. "As a society, we can and must do better," Flynn said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Money talks, they say.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Unfortunately, Gov. Charlie Crist's new budget was talking gibberish, at least for a moment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Crist promised to fulfill the legacy of Gov. Jeb Bush. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One of Bush's important projects was to establish a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention office in the Office of Drug Control.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That proposal kept getting shot down in the Florida Legislature, despite support from Sen. Jim King, R-Jacksonville, among others.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Then, the St. Petersburg Times reported that the governor's budget did not even include the $150,000 for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, he wants to spend $222,000 on public relations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Now, it appears the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention funds may be restored in the budget.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And a scathing editorial can be toned down.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Unfortunately, these missed opportunites are all too common in the field of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Twice as many Floridians die from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than from homicide. Even more tragically, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is largely preventable.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It affects every strata of society. The highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is among the elderly.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For the young, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  takes more lives than cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, stroke, pneumonia, influenza and chronic lung disease combined.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Though the act of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is often sudden, the event usually is foreshadowed by untreated mental illness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But too few people are trained to recognize the signs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Florida's official \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategy includes a basket of tools, including increased awareness, better screening and better access to treatment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It deserves a few people to help coordinate these efforts, a token commitment for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We're talking about preventing the unnecessary loss of human lives, a project that deserves the highest priority from the state. The value of saving a human life? Priceless.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 American Suicidology recently marked National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Week. On Sept. 12, there was a statewide \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Week Initiative Kickoff in the Capitol Rotunda in Harrisburg. There were several organizations represented, and several people spoke out on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention. The governor even issued a proclamation about the week being designated as "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Week." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This is the Yellow Ribbon \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Program's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention and Awareness week. Please wear a yellow ribbon in memory of those who have died of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . I wear a yellow ribbon every day since my 14-year-old son died of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2002. It actually is my way of speaking out about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . A lot of people don't like to talk about the subject of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but it happens, and in Lebanon County alone, I know of at least a dozen people who have died of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the last 18 months. We need to continue to fight the battle to get people to know that, "It's OK to ask 4 help," which is the Yellow Ribbon \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Program's theme.

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  More than 800,000 people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 every year around one person every 40 seconds according to the United Nations health agency's first global report on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, which was published Thursday.  
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "This report is a call for action to address a large public health 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 problem which has been shrouded in taboo for far too long," Dr. Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  The report also notes that the most common methods of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  globally 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 are pesticide poisoning, hanging and firearms. Evidence from Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the United States and a number of European countries reveals that limiting access to these means can help prevent people dying by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  Another key to reducing deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a commitment by national 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Governments to the establishment and implementation of a coordinated plan of action, WHO said in a news release. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  Currently, only 28 countries are known to have national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 prevention strategies.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  Among the other findings if the report, which brings together 10 years 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 of research from around the world, is that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can take place at almost any age. Globally, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates are highest in people aged 70 years and over. In some countries, however, the highest rates are found among the young. Notably, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the second leading cause of death globally in people between the ages of 15 and 29. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  Generally, the report pointed out, more men die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than women. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 In richer countries, three times as many men die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than women. Men aged 50 years and over are particularly vulnerable.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  Also, some 75 per cent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occur in low- and middle-income 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 countries. Young adults and elderly women in these countries have higher rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than their counterparts in high-income countries. Women over 70 years of age are more than twice as likely to die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than women aged between 15 and 29 years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  In addition to limiting access to means of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the report said that 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 other effective measures to reduce deaths include responsible reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the media, such as avoiding language that sensationalizes \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and avoiding explicit description of methods used. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  Early identification and management of mental and substance use 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 disorders in communities and by health workers in particular are also recommended.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  WHO added that follow-up care by health workers through regular contact, 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 including by phone or home visits, for people who have attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , together with provision of community support, are essential, because people who have already attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are at the greatest risk of trying again.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  "This report, the first WHO publication of its kind, presents a 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 comprehensive overview of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts and successful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention efforts worldwide. We know what works. Now is the time to act," Dr. Shekhar Saxena, Director of WHO's Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse, said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  The report's launch comes just a week before World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Day, observed on 10 September every year. The Day provides an opportunity for joint action to raise awareness about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention around the world.

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sri Lanka, Sept. 9 -- \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the act of intentionally causing one's own death, is a complex psychological, biological, social, cultural and environmental issue. In an interview with the Daily News Healthwatch, the Director of National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), Dr. Jayan Mendis said that almost 1 million die from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every year. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Globally 16 per 100,000 die and during the last 50 years the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate has gone up by 60 percent worldwide. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is very high even in the developed countries such as USA where it remains one of the leading causes of death. Unfortunately the current situation is that one \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  takes place somewhere in the world in every 40 seconds.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to Dr.Mendis the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates are reported from Europe, Baltic States and the lowest rates are reported from Latin America and a few Asian countries. In Asia \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate remains very high. In fact 61 percent of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the world occur in Asia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Within Asia, the highest rates are reported from Japan, Sri Lanka, China and Korea. However the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in Sri Lanka is high where 24-26 in 100000 die from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . In Sri Lanka, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate was quite high in the late 1990s.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 1880, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in Sri Lanka was 2.2 which increased up to 21 in 1974. Later it went up to 50. When \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is considered gender wise, it is visible that both male and female rates have increased in the same pattern.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate has been always high when compared to female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate. In Sri Lanka, previously the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate was high among those who are above 60 and the current trend after 2000 is, mostly the younger people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Geographic distribution also has a significance where mostly the people from Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Kurunegala, Vavunia, Matale and Kegalle attempt to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Among those who attempt to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  90 percent suffer from one or more mental disorders.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Major factors
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Genetic/ family history
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 *Traumatic experience in either childhood or adulthood
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Depression
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Alcohol abuse/ other drug abuse
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Poor job security, financial status
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Social isolation
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Relationship breakdown
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Other mental disorders
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As Dr. Mendis noted, it is necessary to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  using new methods and concepts since it is a major public health issue which leads to many other social issues. It is necessary to think of the access to common methods of committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Consuming pesticides has been the most common method used by those who attempt to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and currently medications are also used.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Strict action has to be taken against those who sell medications without doctors' prescriptions and also those who sell pesticides. But the main thing we should improve is the mental health of the people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mental health status of people can be uplifted through many ways. Improving life skills, aesthetic skills and other skills will help make people mentally healthy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Alcohol and other substances prevention is also important. It is necessary to improve emergency medical care for those who attempt to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Special attention should be paid to the increase of adolescent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Psychiatrists need to educate the general public effectively since almost every \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be prevented if detected early and provided adequate care.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A new survey found nearly 3.7 million Koreans have psychiatric disorders associated with a high risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , highlighting the need for the government and society to step up preventive measures. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, a total of 3.68 million people higher chances of dying by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  because of their prolonged mental disorders such as depression and mood disorders.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 About 28 percent of Koreans have suicidal ideas more than once in their lifetime, especially during extreme levels of stress, the report said. By gender, the number of women with a high level of suicidal despair was 2.6 million, 2.4 times more than that of men, it added. Mental illnesses are a major factor associated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . About 10-15 percent of patients with depression die through \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , according to a separate report by the World Health Organization.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In order to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the government needs to identify, assess and manage patients who have history of attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or are at higher risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the state-run health agency said. Currently, mental health centers under local governments are in charge of managing patients with a high risk of mental disorders. But the level of services needs to be improved to better deal with an increasing number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases, it added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report came two days after Cho Sung-min, a former baseball player and the ex-husband of late actress Choi Jin-sil, was found dead in an apparent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on Sunday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Choi killed herself in late 2008 and her younger brother, Jin-young, also died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2010.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The case, which went widely public, also raised concerns that their tragic story could lead to copycat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . A day after the news of Cho's death spread, seven people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Busan alone, reports say.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The psychological and social impact of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on the family and society is enormous, according to World Health Organization, adding that a single \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  case affects at least six other people on average.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Cases of Korean celebrities committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in recent years actually led to an immediate increase in the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  across the country, said Ha Kyu-seob, director of Seoul National Hospital.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Choi's death in October 2008, in particular, was followed by an increase of 1,000 more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for that month. Of the total, 66 percent of people who committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and died chose the same method as Choi.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "About 600 more people died in apparent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , in the same month the news of celebrity \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  went viral through mass media. This proves how \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reports have serious impact on society," said Ha who also chairs the Korean Association of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Re: National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategy needed - June 20
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If almost 4,000 people died in Canada every year, for any reason, we would not stand for it, and something would be done to address the issue. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The fact is, that is the number of people who die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . After years of raising awareness about the realities of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and tireless advocacy efforts at the local, provincial and national level, it looks very promising that we may finally have a nationwide strategy to support communities all across the country.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Guelph Liberal MP Frank Valeriote's impassioned address in the House of Commons about the federal framework for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention is representative of the commitment felt by many. On behalf of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Awareness Council of Wellington-Dufferin (formerly the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Resource Group of Wellington-Dufferin), we applaud the momentum that may finally move our federal government to adopt this important legislation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Bill C-300 would recognize \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as a public health issue, provide guidelines for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, promote collaboration and knowledge exchange regarding \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and define and promote evidence-based practices for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention and its aftermath.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  awareness council has been in existence since 1999, with members who bring diverse perspectives and experiences.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We believe that both individuals and communities can help reduce the incidence of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and its impact, through access to credible information, education and resources available for support.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The council joins all those across Canada who are hopeful that compassion and wisdom will prevail and the legislation for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention now in the Senate for review will be successful.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The devastating news of youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and an alarming increase and string of deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  this year have turned a typically private situation into front-page news.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Most Oklahomans know someone who died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Oklahoma ranks 12th in the nation in deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , which is the second-leading cause of death for Oklahoma youth ages 10-24. In HeartLine's Healthy Education for Life Program, which is free for schools, 25 percent of students are self-identifying as at-risk for depression or \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Further, most young people who die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  tell someone or provide warning signs before attempting it. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the most preventable form of death, and education is the key to prevention. So why are we afraid to talk about it?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Bringing prevention education to schools isn't easy. Administrators struggle with the stigma of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Much like the previous notion of sex education, the belief is that if we talk about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , we will "give students the idea" or cause them to attempt it. Among their other fears is the perception that parents will hold the school accountable if a child dies by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  after they get prevention training.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Talking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  neither causes it nor gives someone the idea. It allows a difficult topic to be discussed and an opportunity for people who are hurting to reach out for help. We know that callers to Oklahoma's 1-800-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 SUICIDE\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and 1-800-273-TALK help lines are at a decreased risk for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  after talking to a crisis specialist.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  School officials also express concern for liability if a student dies by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Legally, schools can't be held liable for a student's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by providing prevention education. In fact, it would speak well of the school to show that it had provided \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention education versus not addressing the topic at all. School officials who adopt this training can feel confident that they've given students information and support.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Administrators often hold onto these fears until they lose a student to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . This tragic loss makes the issue of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  all too real to them, the parents and community; the need to address the topic with students is then realized. Why do we react in the aftermath of a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , or multiple \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but fail to take the necessary steps to prevent the loss of life beforehand?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Some school districts, such as Norman, have been advocates for prevention education for years. Progress is being made in Edmond because Susan Parks, public information officer of Edmond Public Schools, is pushing for preventive measures. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention programs should be required across the state. Schools should see the value in prevention education that teaches students how to identify \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  warning signs, how to get help personally or for a friend, and directs them to appropriate resources.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Let's not wait for the next young person to die before we require schools to educate students on the warning signs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and how to get help.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hong Kong, Sept. 10 -- The University of Hong Kong issued the following news release:
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 The International Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention (IASP) and the World Health Organization are co-sponsoring World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day on September 10th. Events are being held on every continent.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 The International Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention (IASP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) co-sponsor World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day every year on September 10th. This year's observances will include: an education seminar, in Bangalore, India; an Inuit Celebration of life ceremony on Parliament Hill, Canada; workshops for volunteers in Malaysia; countless walks in Australia and America; and thousands of lanterns being released in Ireland.
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about one million people die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every year; this represents a "global" mortality rate of 16 per 100,000, or one death every 40 seconds, or about 3,000 deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  daily. For every person who dies by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , 20 or more attempt to end their lives.
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 IASP President, Dr. Lanny Berman, states, "On World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, September 10, 2011, the theme "Preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Multicultural Societies" will be embraced. As we develop and implement national and local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  intervention strategies we need to be aware of cultural factors that can impact on suicidal behaviour in diverse settings".
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Dr. Berman continues, "We have seen positive outcomes from our tailored approaches to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention. For example, the restriction of the sale of charcoal in supermarket chains in Hong Kong has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by poisoning from charcoal burning, and a concerted community response to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention at a district level shows a positive impact on rates of deliberate self-harm and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ."
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 "In addition," he states, "We now have good evidence that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates are reduced substantially when leaders make preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a central focus for their entire systems, such as in the US Air Force. We also know that significant reductions in rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts have been found when programs aimed at improving recognition and care of depression are implemented."
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 "In Australia, stricter firearm legislation coincided with a significant reduction in the number of firearm \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and, in England, restricted access through altered packaging of over-the-counter- medicines resulted in a reduction in the number of deaths by intentional overdose."
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 "These few examples demonstrate that if we take into account cultural elements, we can make great strides in the advancement of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, understanding and practice."
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 The IASP expects that this year's activities will be held in over 40 countries around the world. In addition, the organization has prepared World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day banners in more than 40 languages which bloggers can use to increase \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention awareness locally and globally in their own language.
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 IASP is encouraging people to light a candle, near a window, at 8 PM, on September 10th, to show their support for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, to remember a loved one lost to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and for those bereaved by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A LOCAL campaigner has called for more funding to fight \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  status as the leading cause of death of males aged 15 to 44.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lifeline Community Care Gold Coast general manager Peter Loughnane said these alarming figures came from the Australia 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Bureau of Statistics after its Causes of Death in Australia survey.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was the primary cause of death among male teenagers and men in the 15-24, 25-34 and 35-44 age groups, he said.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ``Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ranks higher than road accidents and drug or alcohol use, and it is also ranked as the fifth cause of death among men aged from 45-54,'' he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, only between $30 million to $40 million was spent every year on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention compared with $4 billion on
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 preventing road deaths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Loughnane said Lifeline was hoping for a 10 per cent increase in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention funding, which was urgently needed in Queensland as it had the third highest rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the country.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said a federal inquiry would be held into \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and he encouraged residents with an interest in or an experience related to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to make a submission.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ``Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a community health issue and every single \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a tragedy which impacts on communities and families,'' he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The inquiry will investigate the personal, social and financial costs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ``It will also look at the accuracy of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reporting, the role of support agencies and public awareness programs, as well as the effectiveness of the National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Strategy,'' said Mr Loughnane.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ``We know that, tragically, up to seven people are taking their lives every day in Australia and there are about 20-30 times as many \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said there was an urgent need for better, timelier data collection about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ``That way, we will know what is really happening,'' he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lifeline offers support programs for those bereaved by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and also runs its ASIST course to identify and help those showing symptoms of distress.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lifeline telephone counsellors are available 24 hours on 13 11 14.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Submissions to the inquiry are due by November 20 by visiting www.aph.gov.au/senate/commi ttee/clac--ctte/\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 /index.htm

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 risk factors for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 : * Depression and other mental disorders, or a substance-abuse disorder (often in combination with other mental disorders). More than 90 percent of people who die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have these risk factors. * A prior \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt. * Family history of mental disorder or substance abuse.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Family history of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . * Family violence, including physical or sexual abuse. * Firearms in the home. Firearms are used in more than half of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . * Incarceration. * Exposure to the suicidal behavior of others, such as family members, peers or media figures. The National Institute of Mental Health As many as 25 attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occur for every \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  death, and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  claims about 33,000 lives per year. "There are a lot of people hurting out there, for a lot of various reasons," said Pat Flynn, a licensed clinical social worker and practicing psychotherapist with WKM Psychology Clinics in Platteville, Wis., and in private practice in Dubuque. Flynn calls \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "a life needlessly lost." "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is preventable," he said. "We need to listen, observe more carefully and educate ourselves about symptoms." The week beginning Sunday, Sept. 6, is National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Week. "Especially during this week, we need to recognize \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as one of life's most tragic events," Flynn said. "Take threats of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  seriously. If you start at that point and then take a look at what's happening in a person's life, certainly there are obvious signals and signs. The people in that situation are so desperate." Flynn advises that people watch for symptoms and warning signs in their friends and family members. Such signs can include threatening to hurt or kill oneself; withdrawing from friends, family and society; dramatic mood changes; talking or writing about death, dying or \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; and increased alcohol or drug use. "In over 70 percent of completed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , alcohol or drugs are involved," Flynn said, "and often there is a precipitating, traumatic event within the month preceding." Overall the 11th leading cause of death in America, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the third-leading cause of death for young people ages 15 to 24. "Try to communicate with the person (at risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 )," said Todd Lange, of the National Alliance on Mental Illness-Dubuque. "Sometimes people are worried about mentioning the idea, but if you deal with it directly, that can lead to some breakthroughs in communication." \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  also strikes older adults disproportionately, with 14.2 of every 100,000 persons age 65 and older dying by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , compared to the average of 10.9 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 people in the general population. "As a society, we can and must do better," Flynn said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Keywords "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  methods" and other words related to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will be, in principle, banned from input for online communities, blogs and other communal cyber spaces, the Ministry for Health, Welfare and Family Affairs said Monday. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To counter growing group \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the nation, the ministry will join hands with police, telecommunication authorities, civic groups and portals to ban keywords related to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and block access to Web sites.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Among the banned words are "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  methods," "group \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," and other terms pertaining to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Postings containing information about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will be deleted and the operators of online cafes on the subject could be prosecuted. The prosecution recently arrested a Web site operator of an online \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  information cafe.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Rental car dealers, charcoal brisket sellers as well as hotel and inn managers are encouraged to report any "suspicious groups of people" they notice to local police.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Those who report such activities will be rewarded. Newspapers and other media outlets are also requested to "refrain from describing the methods and locations of sites" to prevent further copycat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The move comes as the number of such crimes has increased dramatically since actor Ahn Jae-hwan reportedly killed himself using charcoal briquettes last September. More than 11 cases of "joint \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " have been reported since then, killing 11 and leaving six in critical care.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Jul. 6--Pennsylvania has the third-highest number of murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the nation -- including 14 cases in just six months -- and most involve domestic disputes. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Domestic violence experts say that's even more reason for potential victims to seek help at the first sign of trouble.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Violence Policy Center, a national nonprofit group working to reduce violence in America, recently released a new study on murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The study collected all reported murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  nationwide during the first six months of 2007. In that time, there were at least 554 deaths in 234 murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  -- an average of nine murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a week.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Almost all murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , or 88.5 percent, involved a firearm.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Using these figures, the Violence Policy Center estimates that nearly 1,100 Americans die each year in murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nine states had 10 or more murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the six-month period of the study, with Florida and Texas the highest at 24 each. California had 17, and Pennsylvania had 14.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The study also found:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 --Of the 554 murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths, 234 were \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and 320 were homicides. Ninety-five percent of murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were committed by men.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 --Seventy-three percent of all murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  involved an intimate partner -- spouse, common-law spouse, ex-spouse, or girlfriend/boyfriend. Of these, 94 percent were women killed by their intimate partners.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 --Forty-five of the homicide victims were children and teens less than 18 years of age. Forty-four children and teens less than 18 years of age were survivors who witnessed some aspect of the murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 --Most murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  -- 75 percent -- occurred in the home.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A: Probably both. In Jewish tradition, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is considered murder, the murder of one's self. It is non-prosecutable, but murder nonetheless.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Before rushing to dispute the logic of this position, it needs to be made clear that the Talmudic phrase most often employed to describe \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is "me'abed atzmo la'daat," which literally means destroying one's self with one's full wits. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This means that practically all "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " of modern definition do not qualify as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by Talmudic definition. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  usually remove themselves from this world because they are depressed, seriously depressed, and they are not with their full wits.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The state of mind of the person is at the very core of the issue. One could argue that murder is murder, be it first-degree, second-degree, manslaughter or "justifiable homicide." In a similar vein, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , from a statistical vantage, no matter the reason for the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . But from a Jewish theological perspective, the state of mind is critical.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The rule about frowning, in advance, on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , applies to all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . But the post-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  condemnation does not apply to those who did so out of emotional desperation. These types are not denied any of the honours accorded to people who have died.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , as an act of self destruction, is obviously a sin, but not all sins are equal. We would tell anyone who asks not to take such drastic action, but are full of understanding after the fact and do not enter the vilification arena.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 With \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates so high, and depression rates even higher, we need to ask ourselves, both individually and collectively, what has happened to us, living as we do in this most wondrous country.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Certainly, there are many who are left behind, who do not or cannot enjoy the largesse that Canada offers. Lonely people, unemployed people, poor people, and yes, even rich people, are vulnerable.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As a society, we need to re-tool our values. As individuals, we need to befriend those who are forlorn, to the best of our ability. That will help more than a little bit.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Money talks, they say.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Unfortunately, Gov. Charlie Crist's new budget was talking gibberish, at least for a moment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Crist promised to fulfill the legacy of Gov. Jeb Bush. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One of Bush's important projects was to establish a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention office in the Office of Drug Control.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That proposal kept getting shot down in the Florida Legislature, despite support from Sen. Jim King, R-Jacksonville, among others.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Then, the St. Petersburg Times reported that the governor's budget did not even include the $150,000 for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, he wants to spend $222,000 on public relations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Now, it appears the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention funds may be restored in the budget.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And a scathing editorial can be toned down.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Unfortunately, these missed opportunites are all too common in the field of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Twice as many Floridians die from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than from homicide. Even more tragically, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is largely preventable.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It affects every strata of society. The highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is among the elderly.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For the young, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  takes more lives than cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, stroke, pneumonia, influenza and chronic lung disease combined.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Though the act of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is often sudden, the event usually is foreshadowed by untreated mental illness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But too few people are trained to recognize the signs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Florida's official \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategy includes a basket of tools, including increased awareness, better screening and better access to treatment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It deserves a few people to help coordinate these efforts, a token commitment for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We're talking about preventing the unnecessary loss of human lives, a project that deserves the highest priority from the state. The value of saving a human life? Priceless.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 HITTING HOME
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 TERRIBLE TOLL
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 -- Florida's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is twice its homicide rate: 2,308 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2005 to 988 homicides.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 -- For youth, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the third-leading cause of death.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 -- The highest rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is among the elderly.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 -- In Duval County, which has the state's highest murder rate, there are more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than homicides.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 American Suicidology recently marked National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Week. On Sept. 12, there was a statewide \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Week Initiative Kickoff in the Capitol Rotunda in Harrisburg. There were several organizations represented, and several people spoke out on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention. The governor even issued a proclamation about the week being designated as "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Week." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This is the Yellow Ribbon \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Program's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention and Awareness week. Please wear a yellow ribbon in memory of those who have died of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . I wear a yellow ribbon every day since my 14-year-old son died of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2002. It actually is my way of speaking out about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . A lot of people don't like to talk about the subject of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but it happens, and in Lebanon County alone, I know of at least a dozen people who have died of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the last 18 months. We need to continue to fight the battle to get people to know that, "It's OK to ask 4 help," which is the Yellow Ribbon \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Program's theme.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The widespread belief that New Zealand has a high \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is wrong and dangerous, the Canterbury \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Project says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The project's principal investigator, Annette Beautrais, said that while New Zealand had one of the highest rates of youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among developed countries, it did not occupy such high rankings for adult \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When compared with similar countries, New Zealand ranked lowest for females aged 55 to 64, and second lowest for females aged 35 to 44, and 75 or older. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Beautrais said misconceptions about New Zealand's over- all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate, based on the rate of youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , were harmful.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The difficulty is that if people misconceive \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as being more common than it in fact is, then they will tend to incorporate it into their repertoire of options when things go wrong," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Over all, New Zealand ranked fourth out of 12 countries for the male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate, and eighth for the female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The comparisons with other countries indicate that New Zealand doesn't stand out as a particularly \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 - prone country," Dr Beautrais said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 New Zealand has had the highest rate of youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among comparable countries for the last decade. Dr Beautrais was not certain why New Zealand's youth figures were disproportionately high. "We don't know that, and I wouldn't assume to hazard a guess."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said studies showed young New Zealanders did not tend to think about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  any more than their overseas counterparts. However, their completion rate was higher.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Awareness Trust said yesterday that it hoped the Government would establish a Youth Commissioner to examine New Zealand's high youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "With three kids a week dying at their own hands, how much more research do we need, or talk-fests will we have, before we declare war on the carnage raging amongst our youth," said chairman Gregory Fortuin.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 New Zealand had to change its national "psyche" before it could find a solution to youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

That being so, the argument goes, prohibitions against assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  actually amount to the imposition of religious doctrine on statutory law, which violates the First Amendment's establishment clause.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The entire notion is ridiculous, of course.  Laws prohibiting assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are no more religious than statutes outlawing theft.  For that matter, why shouldn't religious views have as much place in the marketplace of ideas as perspectives founded in philosophy, political ideology, or personal preference? 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But there's another point to make, as well -- which is that religion is only one of the reasons Americans oppose the euthanasia agenda.  In fact, underreported in the popular press, opponents of assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have formed an alliance that cuts across ideological fissures and religious-versus-secular divisions.  The Catholic church participates in this coalition with such distinctly secular national organizations as Not Dead Yet and the National Spinal Cord Injury Association.  The pro-life movement opposes assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but so do most of the world's professional medical organizations, virtually all of which support a right to abortion.  And consider this: One of the nation's most vocal opponents of euthanasia is the venerable civil libertarian and atheist Nat Hentoff.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This loose coalition of strange political bedfellows had not coalesced when Oregon passed its assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  law by a vote of 51 to 49 percent in 1994.  That event, combined with the predations of Jack Kevorkian, sparked its formation.  Since then, the opposition to assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the United States has strengthened.  In 1998, Michigan, the home state of Kevorkian, rejected legalizing assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by a vote of 71 to 29 percent.  In 2000, even liberal Maine turned it down by 51 to 49 percent.  Jack Kevorkian is in a penitentiary.  The United States Supreme Court and the state supreme courts of Florida and Alaska have all refused to recognize a constitutional right to assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0   Meanwhile, people who assist in "private" \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are increasingly being sent to prison for their crimes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Still, the myth persists that opposition to assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is based in religion, and the issue is often presented by the media as a clash between secular modernism and Luddite religion.  That presumption will be impossible to maintain with the publication of \b0 \i \ul0 The Case Against Assisted \b0 \i0 \ul0 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \b \i \ul0 Suicide,\b \i0 \ul0 \cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  edited by Kathleen Foley, one of the nation's foremost experts in pain control and palliative care, and psychiatrist Herbert Hendin, medical director of the American Foundation for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention.
\par \b0 \i \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Case Against Assisted \b0 \i0 \ul0 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \b \i \ul0 Suicide\b \i0 \ul0 \cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  presents a compelling argument for improving the treatment of disabled and dying people.  It is also particularly telling in its analysis of euthanasia in the Netherlands.  "Virtually every guideline set up by the Dutch" designed to protect against abuse "has failed to protect patients or has been modified or violated," the book concludes.  Many critics have attacked Dutch physicians for killing patients who have not requested to be euthanized, but apologists for euthanasia claim the numbers of such deaths are decreasing.  Now Hendin, who has spent years researching Dutch euthanasia, demonstrates that the reverse is actually true: Involuntary and nonvoluntary euthanasia \b0 \i \ul0 rose\b0 \i0 \ul0  from about 1 percent of all Dutch deaths in 1990 to 1.4 percent in 1995.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One wishes we had similar statistics about how the Oregon law is actually working.  In an essay in \b0 \i \ul0 The Case Against Assisted \b0 \i0 \ul0 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \b \i \ul0 Suicide,\b \i0 \ul0 \cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  psychiatrist Gregory Hamilton, president of Oregon's Physicians for Compassionate Care, reveals that rather than being an open experiment as promised by assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  proponents, euthanasia in Oregon is practiced behind a shroud of secrecy.  Most of what we know comes from forms filled out by the doctors who lethally prescribe, and even the Oregon Public Health Services admits it doesn't know if physicians honestly or fully report on their activities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hamilton examines what little we do have from published statistics and a few media reports.  Many patients who have committed assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  did not receive their prescribed overdoses from their own doctors.  Why would the patients' own doctors not participate in their assisted deaths?  We simply don't know.  The Oregon Public Health Services, which will speak only with the doctors who prescribed the overdoses (many of whom are ideologically predisposed to assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and are affiliated with the assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  advocacy groups), has yet to contact other doctors to learn why they refused to assist their patients' \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hamilton also describes the under-reported case of Kate Cheney's assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0   (See "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Unlimited in Oregon" in the November 8, 1999, WEEKLY STANDARD.) Cheney was a cancer-stricken eighty-five-year-old woman with growing dementia.  When she requested assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  she was examined by a psychiatrist who, Hamilton reports, "found her ineligible for assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  because of her obvious cognitive impairments and because her family appeared to be pressuring her." If the guidelines worked as promised, that should have been that.  But it wasn't.  Cheney's daughter merely decided to get another opinion.  Despite finding the daughter to be "somewhat coercive," the second opinion, from a psychologist, approved the assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The practice of doctor shopping until the wanted answer is found is troubling enough.  But the person making the final decision whether to lethally prescribe in the Cheney case was not her own doctor but an administrator for Kaiser Permanente, her HMO.  Did money influence the administrator's decision?  He denies it.  But as Hamilton points out, "this case illustrates how once assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is legalized, there is no way to protect those who are vulnerable and mentally ill from social or even financial pressures."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In another essay in \b0 \i \ul0 The Case Against Assisted \b0 \i0 \ul0 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \b \i \ul0 Suicide,\b \i0 \ul0 \cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Diane Coleman, founder of the national advocacy organization Not Dead Yet, makes the case against legalizing assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from the perspective of the disabled.  Not Dead Yet was formed in reaction to the popular applause at Kevorkian's repeated assistance in the death of people with non-terminal disabilities.  (Approximately 75 percent of Kevorkian's victims were not terminally ill.  At least five had no illnesses or disabilities determinable upon autopsy.) "It was as though 'open season' had been declared on disabled people," Coleman writes.  She convincingly argues that the assisted-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  movement is not really about relieving the suffering associated with terminal illness but about the popular perception that it is better to be dead than disabled.  That attitude often rubs off on disabled people who thus come to see themselves as burdens.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In its final section, \b0 \i \ul0 The Case Against Assisted \b0 \i0 \ul0 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \b \i \ul0 Suicide\b \i0 \ul0 \cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  provides proof that there is a better way to grapple with terminal illness and disability.  Among the contributors to this portion of the book is Dame Cicely Saunders, the British humanitarian who founded the modern hospice movement.  Autonomy, the ideological linchpin of the euthanasia movement, she writes, "must be seen in the context of a society that emphasizes youth and active achievement and so cannot be trusted not to bring pressure on those it considers an emotional or economic burden."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In another chapter, Hendin and Foley examine the physical symptoms, psychological distress, and existential dread of serious illness.  Indeed, ill people who express a desire for assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  do it more out of fear of being a burden or losing the ability to engage in enjoyable activities than because of pain.  Moreover, these problems can generally be ameliorated.  Unfortunately, too many doctors -- and patients -- are inadequately educated about such matters.  Remedying this deficiency is a worthy project for a great nation, and the continuing struggle over assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is just getting in the way.
\par \b0 \i \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Case Against Assisted \b0 \i0 \ul0 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \b \i \ul0 Suicide\b \i0 \ul0 \cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is not exactly beach reading, but the issues of medicalized killing and proper end-of-life care deserve the substance and seriousness that the contributors bring to this important volume.  Its through documentation and powerful analysis provide a convincing -- and wholly secular -- case for refusing to allow doctors to kill their suffering patients.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To the Editor:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Re ''The Irony of Despair'' (column, Dec. 6):
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 David Brooks rightly emphasizes the baneful effects of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on surviving friends and families. Indeed, the writer Jennifer Michael Hecht, cited by Mr. Brooks, argues that ''when a person kills himself, he does wrenching damage to the community.'' 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Two additional points merit discussion. First, most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occur in the context of serious psychiatric disorders, like major depression, and successful treatment can reduce the likelihood of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Second, the United States has a firearms-related \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate almost six times higher than comparison countries, and numerous studies have found that a gun in the home is associated with increased risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , particularly when the gun isn't properly secured.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Finally, contrary to the popular notion that suicidal people will inevitably find a way to kill themselves, most such people are crying out for help and can be deterred from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with timely assessment and treatment.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The writer is a psychiatrist associated with SUNY Upstate Medical University and Tufts University.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To the Editor:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's hard to know where to start in responding to David Brooks's column. Is it his simplistic statement that people who attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  need ''an idea or story to bring them to the edge of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and to justify their act''? Is it the offensive comment that ''\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is an act of chronological arrogance''? Or is it his approval of Jennifer Michael Hecht's idea that ''\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is delayed homicide''?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What is most disturbing to those of us who work in the field of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention is that he is perpetuating the myth that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a rational and selfish act carried out by the weak. It's another example of misunderstanding the reality of mental illness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The causes of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are complex, and often a result of anguish driven by mental illness. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a tragedy and one that we are working to prevent by funding research on the brain, partnering with public and private organizations to design effective interventions, and supporting those who have suffered a loss.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is nothing ironic about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 THE MARIN \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Committee is reaching out to educate the public about the warning signs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and who to call for help.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The committee was formed out of the North Bay \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Project, a program of Family Service Agency of Marin. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The project recently co-sponsored a regional \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Network meeting. More than 80 community members attended, including members of law enforcement, veterans, school personnel and medical and social services providers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As part of the project, Sonoma, Napa, Lake, Mendocino and Solano counties will also be establishing local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention committees in their counties.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 How common is \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nationally, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the third leading cause of death among youth between 10-24 years of age. But older adults, particularly men over 75, have the highest rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . More Californians have died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than by homicide. Nine Californians lose their lives to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on an average day.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 By comparison, 11 lives are lost daily in traffic collisions. Ninety percent of individuals who die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had a diagnosable mental illness or substance abuse disorder at the time of their death.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Marin, 35 residents died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2010.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Some myths and facts about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 :
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 MYTH: Asking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will give someone the idea and can be very harmful to a depressed person.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 FACT: Raising the question of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shows you are taking that person seriously and responding to their pain. Encouraging them to talk about suicidal feelings can be a therapeutic first step.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 MYTH: There are no warning signs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . If happens without warning.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 FACT: \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has many warning signs, but people do not always notice them.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 MYTH: More women complete \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than men.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 FACT: Women are three times more likely to attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but men successfully complete \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  3.7 times that of women.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 MYTH: \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  only happens among a specific socio-economic class and can be fully explained by sociological factors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 FACT: \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is represented proportionally among all levels of society.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Here are some of the warning signs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 :

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 HYDERABAD, Dec. 11 -- The Union government's decision to decriminalise attempt to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has been welcomed in the State. While medical experts believe the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reported are unbelievably lower than the actual number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  they point out that for every \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at least 10 attempt to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases take place.The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data for 2013 reveals that united Andhra Pradesh stood fourth across the country in terms of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths. A total of 12,328 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were recorded in a single year. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It was a long pending decision and is most relevant today. Criminalising \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  never was a deterrent", says Dr Diana Monteiro, counselling psychologist and director of Hyderabad Academy of Psychology.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Feminist writer and founder of Asmita Resource Centre for Women Vasanth Kannabiran welcomed the decision. She said: "To live or not is up to one's own but you cannot punish a person who is already suffering."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Advocate Md Rahimuddin, a child rights activist and member of SCPCR, believes that the government decision should not send a negative message to people. "Decriminalising does not mean that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts should be dealt with a blind eye. Along with removing the section from the statute book, the government needs to take steps to reduce \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " he felt.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to him, root cause of any \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or attempt to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is socio-economic in nature. "If we continue to ignore the causes of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at the grassroots level and do not provide the necessary assistance, there is nothing that is going to change," he added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Monteiro added that increased awareness on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention measures would sensitise the public.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 HYDERABAD, Dec. 6 -- \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a global issue and a leading cause
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 of death in the world claiming lives of around one million people every
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 year.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a multi-dimensional disorder, which results from a complex
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 interaction of biological, genetic, psychological and environmental 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 factors, said eminent psychiatric of Sir Cowasji Jehangir (S.C.J.)
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Institute of Psychiatry, Hyderabad Dr. Darya Khan Laghari, Thursday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr. Darya Khan Laghari, said that some psychology experts also agree
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 with the fact that majority of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are usually linked to
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 economic difficulties but there are other reasons behind committing of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and these reasons can be depressive disorders, unemployment, domestic violence, parental separation, growing economic instability,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 child abuse, bullying, rising inflation and loss of social cohesion which
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 force a person to end his or her life or release them from the pain they
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 are suffering from.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Talking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombing he said a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bomber blows himself,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 also causing an immense and fatal destruction in the areas around it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He added that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombing is also one of the ways that enable a
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 person to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and end his life through such a sinful way.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said that these are some instances, which appear through media as
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 many cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Pakistan are not reported.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In recent years, psychiatrist said that Pakistan has witnessed a
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 drastic increase in the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but the basic thing is that it does not collect national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  statistics nor report them to WHO (World Health Organization) so due to that it has become very difficult to compile \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  statistics and thus made the planning of prevention programmes, almost impossible.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said that the facts showed that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has not only become a
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 health problem in Pakistan, but that there are no official statistics and national rates are unknown. The other reason to support this aspect is also that when a person attempts \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  his or her family usually tries to
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 cover this act and claims this incident as merely an incident thus it is becoming difficult for Pakistan to compile national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  statistics and report them to the WHO, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is consistently higher in men than women
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 and men outnumber women by 2:1 and there are more single then married men
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 involved.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said that the surveys and analysis showed that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 become more common in youth than in adult in many countries and Pakistan
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 is one of them. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates among youth are increasing due to
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 unemployment, pressure of work and studies, depression, anxiety and
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 increasing poverty, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr. Darya Khan Laghari further elaborated that Pakistan's population
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 is 162 million and it is ranked as the 6th most populous country in the world. The official unemployment stands at 12 percent of the eligible workforce and health spending is only 0.7 percent of the national annual budget, he said and added that Pakistan is also a Muslim country and according to Islam \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is considered forbidden and prohibited.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Islam is the only religion that has a clear scriptural ban on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 so, it has an independent effect on lowering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates but still many
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  everyday in Pakistan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to World Health Organisation (WHO) statistics, he said that
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 more than a million people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year worldwide, while the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt is successful 10-20 times.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and depression are linked to each other as more
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 than 80 percent of people who commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  suffer from depression. He
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 said studies suggest that lifetime risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in people with
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 depression was 15 percent, with alcoholism 7-15 percent and with schizophrenia, 4-10 percent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, a substantial proportion of people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  die
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 without having seen a mental health professional, he said and added that detection, referral and management of psychiatric disorders in primary
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 care was an important step in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 New York, Sept 5 (IBNS) More than 800,000 people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every year - around one person every 40 seconds - according to the United Nations health agency's first global report on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, which was published on Thursday. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This report is a call for action to address a large public health problem which has been shrouded in taboo for far too long, said Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO). The report also notes that the most common methods of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  globally are pesticide poisoning, hanging and firear Evidence from Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the United States and a number of European countries reveals that limiting access to these means can help prevent people dying by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Another key to reducing deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a commitment by national Governments to the establishment and implementation of a coordinated plan of action, WHO said in a news release. Currently, only 28 countries are known to have national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategies. Among the other findings if the report, which brings together 10 years of research from around the world, is that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can take place at almost any age. Globally, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates are highest in people aged 70 years and over. In some countries, however, the highest rates are found among the young. Notably, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the second leading cause of death globally in people between the ages of 15 and 29. Generally, the report pointed out, more men die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than women. In richer countries, three times as many men die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than women. Men aged 50 years and over are particularly vulnerable. Also, some 75 per cent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occur in low- and middle-income countries. Young adults and elderly women in these countries have higher rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than their counterparts in high-income countries. Women over 70 years of age are more than twice as likely to die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than women aged between 15 and 29 years. In addition to limiting access to means of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the report said that other effective measures to reduce deaths include responsible reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the media, such as avoiding language that sensationalizes \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and avoiding explicit description of methods used. Early identification and management of mental and substance use disorders in communities and by health workers in particular are also recommended. WHO added that follow-up care by health workers through regular contact, including by phone or home visits, for people who have attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , together with provision of community support, are essential, because people who have already attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are at the greatest risk of trying again. This report, the first WHO publication of its kind, presents a comprehensive overview of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts and successful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention efforts worldwide. We know what works. Now is the time to act, said Shekhar Saxena, Director of WHOs Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse. The reports launch comes just a week before World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, observed on 10 September every year. The Day provides an opportunity for joint action to raise awareness about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention around the world.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Re ''The Irony of Despair'' (column, Dec. 6):
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 David Brooks rightly emphasizes the baneful effects of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on surviving friends and families. Indeed, the writer Jennifer Michael Hecht, cited by Mr. Brooks, argues that ''when a person kills himself, he does wrenching damage to the community.'' 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Two additional points merit discussion. First, most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occur in the context of serious psychiatric disorders, like major depression, and successful treatment can reduce the likelihood of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Second, the United States has a firearms-related \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate almost six times higher than comparison countries, and numerous studies have found that a gun in the home is associated with increased risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , particularly when the gun isn't properly secured.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Finally, contrary to the popular notion that suicidal people will inevitably find a way to kill themselves, most such people are crying out for help and can be deterred from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with timely assessment and treatment.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To the Editor:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's hard to know where to start in responding to David Brooks's column. Is it his simplistic statement that people who attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  need ''an idea or story to bring them to the edge of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and to justify their act''? Is it the offensive comment that ''\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is an act of chronological arrogance''? Or is it his approval of Jennifer Michael Hecht's idea that ''\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is delayed homicide''?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What is most disturbing to those of us who work in the field of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention is that he is perpetuating the myth that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a rational and selfish act carried out by the weak. It's another example of misunderstanding the reality of mental illness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The causes of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are complex, and often a result of anguish driven by mental illness. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a tragedy and one that we are working to prevent by funding research on the brain, partnering with public and private organizations to design effective interventions, and supporting those who have suffered a loss.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is nothing ironic about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 NEW DELHI: Divorce, "illegitimate pregnancy" and professional/career problems seem to be pushing more people to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . According to the NCRB report, in 2011, at least 16 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every hour and the total figure was 1.35 lakh. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While family problems accounted for almost one-fourth of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , illness was another major reason.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Interestingly, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  due to divorce and "illegitimate pregnancy" saw a rise of 54% and 20% respectively in 2011.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report showed that 70% of victims were married and Rajasthan recorded maximum mass family \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the country. Statistics and trends compiled by the board showed that social and economic causes led most men to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  whereas emotional and personal causes mainly drove women to take the extreme step.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Underlying the economic angle to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the report said 38% of victims were self-employed whereas the share of those with permanent jobs (government jobs) committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was negligible at 1.2%.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 West Bengal, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka accounted for 56.2% of the total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the country while West Bengal recorded the highest number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims. Among 53 mega cities with over 10 lakh population, Chennai registered 2,438 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  while Bangalore (1,717), Delhi (1,385) and Mumbai (1,162) followed. The four cities reported almost 36.7% of the total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report showed Nagaland reporting the highest increase of 175% in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2011 compared to the previous year while in Chandigarh, it increased by 47.9%.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The data showed 72 mass/family \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Rajasthan and 19 in Kerala. Using poison and hanging were the two most common modes of committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  across the country.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The committee was formed out of the North Bay \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Project, a program of Family Service Agency of Marin. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The project recently co-sponsored a regional \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Network meeting. More than 80 community members attended, including members of law enforcement, veterans, school personnel and medical and social services providers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As part of the project, Sonoma, Napa, Lake, Mendocino and Solano counties will also be establishing local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention committees in their counties.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 How common is \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nationally, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the third leading cause of death among youth between 10-24 years of age. But older adults, particularly men over 75, have the highest rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . More Californians have died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than by homicide. Nine Californians lose their lives to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on an average day.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 By comparison, 11 lives are lost daily in traffic collisions. Ninety percent of individuals who die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had a diagnosable mental illness or substance abuse disorder at the time of their death.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Marin, 35 residents died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2010.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Some myths and facts about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 :
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 MYTH: Asking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will give someone the idea and can be very harmful to a depressed person.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 FACT: Raising the question of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  shows you are taking that person seriously and responding to their pain. Encouraging them to talk about suicidal feelings can be a therapeutic first step.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 MYTH: There are no warning signs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . If happens without warning.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 FACT: \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has many warning signs, but people do not always notice them.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 MYTH: More women complete \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than men.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 FACT: Women are three times more likely to attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but men successfully complete \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  3.7 times that of women.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 MYTH: \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  only happens among a specific socio-economic class and can be fully explained by sociological factors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 FACT: \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is represented proportionally among all levels of society.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Here are some of the warning signs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 :
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Talking about wanting to die or to kill oneself.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The notion of "clustering" of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths remains poorly understood, and is currently under scrutiny in our national research project at UCD titled 'The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Ireland Survey'.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This project, which has been operating for the past two years, has attracted families from every county in Ireland, who have volunteered to share their story about the life of their lost loved one to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , in the hope that this will help advance our knowledge and understanding of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and may help save lives in the future.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To date, we have interviewed over 250 relatives and friends about the lives of 104 lost loved ones to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . This is a painstaking research process, undertaken mostly in people's homes, and includes four hours of conversational engagement with each family, followed by many additional hours of sifting though medical records, coroners' reports and other information.   
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Our preliminary findings, which we presented at the recent Console Annual Conference, reported 10 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  clusters among 104 index cases, accounting for an additional 46 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As such, it is this first national glimpse at patterns (and themes) of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  across counties and within communities in Ireland. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Consistent with international literature, the young (under 18) and very young (under 16) seem to be particularly vulnerable to a young peer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  death, and while young male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a particular problem nationally in Ireland, young females appear to be at added or equal increased vulnerability following a very young male or female peer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  death.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Undoubtedly, peer bereavement effects of youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are significantly under-estimated. Following two years of research, we are only at the beginning of our analyses, such is the complexity of the problem we are studying.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We have devised a new classification for our cases as either "singleton \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths", "associated \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths" or "clusters", so that we are conservative in our rationale for declaring clusters as such. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Certainly, we are not rushing to publish our findings until we have taken account of a multitude of factors to avoid publishing false positive findings.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Risks 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The risks of anecdotal, rushed and sensationalised media reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths include reporting false positive clusters.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For example, our research team reanalysed the media data about the Bridgend "cluster" of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We found that several of the cases included in the widely reported "cluster" were in fact unassociated singleton \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is tempting for the media to inflate, stretch or sensationalise where possible to capture the reader's attention, and the subject of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is no exception.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Whether it does any favours for society, especially in relation to such sensitive topics as youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or potential \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  clusters, is open to debate. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Whether it does any favours for grieving families, whose privacy is often compromised by such reporting, should also be a concern.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I am aware of an allegation currently under investigation in relation to a journalist who allegedly told some young, recently bereaved peers of a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victim that she was a bereavement counsellor and asked directions to the home of the grieving family, and then subsequently splashed "the story" with images of the deceased.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Voyeurism 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Tragically, youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attracts voyeurism and media interest, whereas we really should be consoling the bereaved.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We should also be generating and funding a sustained national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  research agenda, moving us from awareness to knowledge and understanding, to inform tailored and sustained national, regional, county and community action, designed to save the lives of our at-risk youth.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 More than 33,000 people killed themselves in Japan in 2007, the 10th year in a row that the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  exceeded 30,000, the National Police Agency announced Thursday. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It was the second-highest rate since statistics were first kept in 1978.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Among the 33,093 people who took their own lives in 2007, up 2.9 percent from 2006, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by people in their 30s and those aged 60 or older hit record highs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the latest data, many elderly people killed themselves because they felt lonely. Many people in the prime of their working lives committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  because they were fatigued from work. Many elderly people and people who have heavier social and financial burdens apparently felt socially isolated or were psychologically stymied.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by people in their 60s or older was 12,107, 36.6 percent of the total and up 8.9 percent from the previous year. This age group made up the largest portion of the 2007 figure.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by people in their 50s was 7,046, down 2.8 percent from the previous year. However, the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by people in their 40s was 5,096--up 1.8 percent. The number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by those in their 30s was 4,767, up 6 percent. People of prime working age--those in their 30s and 40s--accounted for 29.8 percent of the year's total.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, 3,309 people in their 20s killed themselves--down 2.5 percent, and 548 people who are 19 or younger killed themselves --down 12 percent. Included in that figure were eight primary school children, 51 middle school students and 215 high school students.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Of the total, 23,478 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were committed by men and 9,615 were committed by women.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The NPA specified motives for 23,209 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  based on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  notes, messages posted on Web sites and other sources.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Multiple motives are listed in many cases. The NPA counted all motives for each \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in its 2007 figures for the first time, and added new motives including job-related fatigue; child-rearing trouble and bullying.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  committed for health reasons was 14,684 last year, the highest of any category. That figure was followed by 7,318 debt and finance-related \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for domestic reasons ranked third, with 3,751, and workplace-related \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ranked fourth with 2,207. Relationship-related \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was the fifth-leading cause at 949 and school-related \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  followed with 338.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The top motive for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by people in their 60s or older was failing health with 6,735, followed by loneliness-related \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with 277.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  related to financial problems, 1,973 deaths were linked to heavy debts from multiple consumer loans, while 1,656 had other debts. Another 1,137 struggled with life's hardships. Of job-related \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , fatigue from work was the top motive with 672 related deaths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Of school-related \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , 14 deaths were linked to bullying.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The record domestic level of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was 34,427 in 2003.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The media will today be urged to follow new guidelines on the coverage of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  which aim to promote responsible coverage of the issue and reduce the risk of "copycat" deaths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The National Office for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention, based in the Health Service Executive (HSE), is funding an awareness campaign around guidelines developed by experts and support groups such as the Samaritans and Irish Association of Suicidology.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Research suggests that while the media can play a powerful role in informing the public about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , some types of portrayal can act as a catalyst to influence the behaviour of vulnerable people. For example, in the week following an episode of Casualty on the BBC - which included a storyline about a paracetamol overdose - rates of self-poisoning in the UK increased by 175 per cent. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Ireland, experts estimate that around six per cent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are as a result of "copycat" behaviour. Those most at risk appear to be those under 24, although there is growing evidence that older people are also at high risk.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The new guidelines to be published today offer "practical and sensible" advice to the media over reporting or dramatising the issue, such as listing the details or further sources of information and advice; not romanticising of glorifying \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; avoiding simplistic explanations for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; not implying there are "positive" results to be gained by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They also suggest avoiding phrases such as a "successful" \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt or the use of terms such as "to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " and "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victim". Instead, the guidelines encourage the use of phrases such as "a completed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 "; "to die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " and a "person at risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The guidelines also include common myths about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  (see panel) aimed at clearing up much of the confusion and misunderstanding about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The head of the National Office for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Geoff Day said the need to continue to encourage responsible reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was important in a fast-changing media environment. "We're not mandating anyone to do this. These are more helpful hints to promote good and responsible coverage of the media. The key things we want to avoid are glamorising or sensationalising \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Studies suggest positive portrayal of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the media has had striking results. For example, a study following the death of Nirvana's lead singer Kurt Cobain found there was no overall increase in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in his hometown of Seattle, largely as a result of a close collaboration between media and authorities to ensure appropriate reporting took place. This focused on Cobain's gifted musical ability, in contrast to the wastefulness of his death. Attention also focused on an emotional eulogy by his wife, Courtney Love, who spoke of the futility of his death.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Samaritans offer 24-hour confidential emotional support to people in distress and at risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . They can be contacted on 1850 60 90 90. Information is also available at www.samaritans.org
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 : myths and facts
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Myth: "If someone is going to kill themselves, there is nothing you can do about it"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: If you can offer appropriate help and emotional support to people experiencing deep unhappiness and distress, you can reduce their risk of dying by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Myth: "Suicidal people are fully intent on dying"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is not a lifestyle choice. The majority who die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are ambivalent about living or dying and many who experience suicidal thoughts don't really want to die. They cannot see a way to go on living with their distress.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Myth: "Talking about it encourages it"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: On the contrary, talking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in a controlled, supportive, educational and informative way will not lead to its "normalisation" or encourage people to think of taking their lives... Not to talk about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  makes it harder for someone to open up about their feelings and could prevent them finding a way forward.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  CELEBRITY \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have such an influence on the public that imitative \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are 14 times more common than in other cases, a study has shown. The effect has long been suspected but the evidence has been equivocal. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  As long ago as 1774, Goethe's novel The Sorrows of Young Werther was banned in many European cities after inspiring imitative \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . When Marilyn Monroe killed herself in 1962, there were an additional 303 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in America the following month, an increase of 12 per cent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In an effort to establish a definite connection, Simon Stack, of Wayne State University in Detroit, made a comprehensive study of media reports concerning celebrity \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Writing in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, Dr Stack said that imitative \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were 14.3 times more likely after somebody famous had killed themselves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He reported that newspaper reports were four times more likely to encourage imitative \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than fictional tales such as Goethe's, or \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in films or television dramas. Dr Stack added that celebrity \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were likely to arouse a much greater degree of iden- tification than stories about someone ordinary taking his or her own life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The theory is that when a rich and famous person commits \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , people who are suicidal and have neither fame nor fortune can lose hope. Dr Stack suggested that more sensitive handling of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  stories by the media could reduce the effect.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Swiss and Austrian media have been persuaded to follow guidelines on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  coverage.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In Austria the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on the Vienna underground train network fell from nine every six months to between one and four when sensational coverage of each \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ceased.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In Switzerland the media also changed their coverage, but the effects there were less clear.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The recent case involving a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  linked to the Internet--in which a 24-year-old Tokyo woman took her own life by swallowing cyanide capsules that she allegedly ordered over the Net from a teacher in Sapporo, who also committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on the day she died--has revealed a darker side to the World Wide Web.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While offering an abundance of useful information, the Net also provides cover for some dangerous networks that have brought about a number of deaths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This most recent case indicates that users are exchanging dangerous, even deadly, information with people they have never even met. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Search engines reveal that there are more than 24,000 Japanese Web sites that can be found using the keyword "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ." Some of these sites already have reactions to the recent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  case uploaded onto them.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One site proclaims that not all sites about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  encourage people to kill themselves. "There are pages that encourage \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but these pages are outnumbered by pages intended to cheer up those who have been subjected to bullying," the site says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Another page reads, "When I'm forced to visit so many sites that tell visitors how to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , I get so angry that I want to throw the mouse (at my computer screen)."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Most sites have been designed to discourage or offer counseling to people considering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , though others include comments that seem to hint at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One site, titled "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  project," presents manuals on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that tell visitors how to jump from a building, or how to strangle or poison themselves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Another macabre site exhibits photos showing how the creator of the site attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by slashing his arm, meticulously displaying photos of his preparations for the attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and photos of the blood flowing down his arm.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Yet another site describes how its creator attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in November last year by taking an excessive amount of antidepressant medicine that he obtained by saving a quantity of the medicine each time it was prescribed by his doctor.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The site revealed details of the attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , including how he determined the necessary dosage, calculated by his weight.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Generally speaking, people usually feel relaxed and clearer after writing down (what they feel) and posting it on their site." Rika Kayama, a psychoanalyst, said. "But at the same time, for some people, expressing themselves online may only serve to make their particular feelings more profound and intense."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The Internet may also provide a way to expand on one's feeling in an unsound way, as when a person starts jotting down his or her feelings, as if they were 'telling their story,' so to speak," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Such online messages--if sent as e-mail, and read by others--leads to the creation of a space that can be defined as 'dramatic.' Drama prevents people from making well planned decisions about whether they really want to die or not," Kayama added.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A new report from the Utah Department of Health suggests the number of Utah \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  continues to climb, with preliminary data pointing to 500 deaths for 2011. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The year before, 456 Utahns died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  compared to 357 in 2006.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is one of those things that can be uncomfortable to talk about," Jenny Johnson, of the department's Violence and Injury Prevention Program, said in a news release. "But the data show this is an alarming problem in our state that we can't ignore any longer."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Though men between the ages of 25 and 64 make up 53 percent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths, more women attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than men. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Coalition has been formed to work to decrease \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides and suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts. A public awareness campaign will begin later this year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Help is available 24 hours a day at a statewide crisis line 801-587-3000 or the National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention LifeLine at 1-800-273-TALK. More information is also available at:www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 September 3, 2009 (Jackson, MS) - \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a preventable tragedy that is becoming a silent epidemic in Mississippi. Out of the 392 reported deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2007 in Mississippi, 50 of those deaths were young adults who felt so hopeless that they decided to take their own lives. In partnership with the Mississippi Youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Council, the Mississippi Department of Mental Health's (DMH) goal is to bring attention to youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  during National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Week, September 6-12. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be prevented especially if people understand the facts, warning signs and know how to get help. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Here are some facts about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 :
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Most people who are having thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are undecided about living or dying. It is important to help a person who is having thoughts identify their reason for living.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Asking someone if they are thinking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  won't cause them to consider or attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Many times, people who are having thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are actually relieved that someone has recognized their warning signs and is concerned enough to ask.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 By arming Mississippians with knowledge about warning signs, we hope to make an impact to make an impact among the youth in our state. Warning signs are especially important for family and friends to remember. Warning signs include: withdrawal, personality and mood changes, problems concentrating, problems at school, lost of interest in activities, feelings of hopelessness, and changes in eating and sleeping habits. Young adults often give indirect verbal clues that they are considering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . They may make statements such as: "You will be better off without me" or "Pretty soon you won't have to worry about me."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "While adults may become quiet or depressed, many times teenagers seem irritable or depressed or aggressive when they are having thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," said Kris Jones, Director of Division the Division of Disaster Preparedness and Response. "Another sign parents often miss is when a teen becomes cheerful after a period of depression. While this may seem like a good thing, it could be that they have made a decision to attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and feel relieved or at peace because they are no longer struggling to make a decision."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Many parents think their child would never consider \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; however statistics show this just isn't true. In Mississippi, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the 3rd leading cause of death among young adults. The MS High School Survey for the Youth Risk Behavior (2007) reported that 13.4% of students seriously considered \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the past 12 months, and 10.6% of students made a plan about how they would commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the past 12 months.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If you know someone who is talking, writing or thinking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  acknowledge the problem, let your friend or family member know that you care and want to help and tell someone. Shattering the silence around \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the first step to preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . If you or someone you know needs immediate help, contact the National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Lifeline at 1 -800-273-TALK.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 NEW YORK
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ONE OF THE MOST PERVASIVE myths about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is that the rate increases during the holiday season. In fact, this is the time of year that the rate is lowest. This might be hard to fathom because this misconception has been part of our culture for a long time and continues to be perpetuated through the media. However, the truth is that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is actually highest in April and May. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dispelling myths and misconceptions surrounding \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is vital to prevention, so it is important to take this opportunity to discuss more  fictions and facts  concerning this issue.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fiction: People who kill themselves are selfish and weak.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: More than 90 percent of people who die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have an underlying mental illness, such as depression or substance abuse, at the time of their death. Sometimes these mental illnesses are recognized, but often they go unnoticed and untreated. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is not the result of selfishness or weakness, but the result of painful and debilitating illnesses that can sometimes be fatal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fiction: If someone wants to take his own life there is nothing anyone can do to stop him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: Some people who kill themselves are conflicted about life or death. Others are suicidal because they want to end the pain caused by their mental illness. Depression is the most common mental illness associated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and may cause intense inner pain as well as physical ailments such as headaches, back, chest or stomach pain, insomnia, etc.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Early recognition and vigorous treatment of depression and other illnesses that may lead to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the best way to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . We must also eradicate the stigma that surrounds seeking help for treatable conditions.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fiction: \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  only happens to  other  families.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: Sadly, it is estimated that over the course of our lifetime, 20 percent of us will lose a family member to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and 60 percent of us will know someone who will take his or her own life. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cuts across all socioeconomic, race, age, and gender lines.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fiction: Teenagers and college students are the most at risk for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: While it is true that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the third leading cause of death among adolescents and young adults ages 15-24, and the second leading cause of death among college students, in the U.S. the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate actually increases with age. Men 75 and older are at the highest risk for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fiction: Asking someone if he is suicidal will put the thought in his head and could lead him to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: If your fear someone you know is depressed and suicidal, don t be afraid to ask whether he or she is considering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or even if they have a particular plan in mind. If they say they are considering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , do not try to argue them out of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Instead, be direct, listen and let them know you care, that depression is treatable and that problems can be solved. If \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  crisis is imminent, take your friend or loved one to the emergency room or call 911. The national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention lifeline (800-273-TALK) is another resource for crisis situations.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Adolescent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention and Early Intervention and the West Virginia Council for the Prevention of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have collaborated to form a support group to serve the Kanawha Valley.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Survivors of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  (or SOS) has been created to meet weekly, addressing the needs of family members, friends and others who are dealing with the loss of someone they know to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The support group's first meeting took place on Oct. 4.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SOS meets at 6:30 p.m. every Thursday in the fourth-floor conference room of the Davidson Building, 910 Quarrier St. in Charleston. (On-street parking is generally readily available after 6 p.m., group members note.)
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to SOS material, the support group is intended to help participants confront and work through difficult personal questions such as "How can I heal?", "Could I have done anything to prevent the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ?" and "Can I face the holidays?"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "While time is an important factor in any healing," the SOS release asserts, "time alone is not enough when trying to understand the issue of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This group will allow for the sharing of feelings that only someone directly affected by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "That support will then help lead to growth and healing."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ONE out of every four people who attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has a family member who also tried to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a study sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health has found. The number is higher than previous estimates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In previous studies, about one in 14 people who attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had relatives who had also tried to kill themselves. The new study involved 2,304 Los Angeles residents; the earlier estimates were based on interviews with mental patients and their families. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The chief investigator in the new study, Dr. Susan Sorenson, a psychologist at the University of California at Los Angeles, said she believed that the new study offered a more realistic view of the incidence of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts because it looked at the general population. She said previous studies were limited in scope.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr. Sorenson said that having a family history of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was not, in itself, a predictor of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  But mental illness can promote clusters of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts in families, she said. One's own mental illness, the mental disorder of a parent or a parent's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can contribute to a person's sense of social isolation, she said.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  studies have consistently found that women have a higher rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts than men. In the new study, women were four and a half times as likely as men to attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Dr. Sorenson said. Unmarried women with a history of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the family were at a higher risk for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts than men or married women.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr. Sorenson said future research would focus on the nature of the family's response to the attempt and to factors that might make members of such families more prone to social isolation and to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 New Delhi: India accounts for the largest number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the world, reveals a World Health Organisation (WHO) report released on Thursday. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The first such report ever brought out by WHO is based on data from 2012, the year India reported 2,58,075 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - nearly 32% of the 8,00,000 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reported from across the world. It works out to one \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  nearly every two minutes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 China, the only other country to hit six-digits, reported 1,20,730 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 India, however, does not have the highest rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the world: that is, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as a percentage of population. At 23.3%, India's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is far lower than Guyana (48.3%) or South Korea (38.5%). What's better is that it went down 9.2% in the 10 years since 2000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report, titled "Preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 : A Global Imperative", is part of the international organisation's Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2020 in which member states committed to work towards reducing their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates by 10%. Interestingly, it was India that proposed the resolution that led to the action plan being taken up for consideration by the WHO executive board.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In India, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is highest -  35.5% - among the 15-29 years age group - among women in this group, it is even higher at 36.1%. Also, men, in general, are more wont to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  the study shows.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The WHO data is in line with the Million Deaths Survey conducted by the Centre for Global Health Research in 2011, which had reported about 1,87,000 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths in India in 2010.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The figures are, however, at odds with figures put out by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) which put the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2012 at 1,35,445. "This indicates a decrease of 0.1% over the previous year's figure (1,35,585). The number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the country during the decade (2002-2012) has recorded an increase of 22.7% (1,35,445 in 2012 from 1,10,417 in 2002)," the NCRB report said. Among Indian states, according to the NCRB data, Tamil Nadu accounted for the largest percentage of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at 12.5%, followed by Maharashtra at 11.9%, West Bengal at 11% and Andhra Pradesh at 10.5%.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The NCRB figures are generally thought to underestimate the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  figures. The WHO report is a wake-up call. Unfortunately, the government continues to look at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as a social issue and not as a public health issue. The mental health bill which seeks to decriminalise \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , now in parliament, is a good start," said Vikram Patel, director, Centre of Mental Health Public Health Foundation of India.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Text of report by Afghan Ariana TV international
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 [Presenter] Saudi Arabia's grand mufti says \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombings are prohibited in Islam and calls the [\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ] bombers criminals.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombings are totally against the Islamic principles. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, some Afghan religious scholars also support the remarks by the grand mufti and urge Pakistani religious scholars to condemn \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attacks.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 My colleague with more details:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 [Correspondent] Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al-Asheikh has condemned \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombings as a grave crime, reiterating his stance in strong words.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 [Text of remarks by Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdulazizi, captioned] Killing oneself is a grave crime and a grave sin. Those who kill themselves with explosives are criminals who are hastening their way to hell. The hearts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombers have veered away from the right path. Their minds have been invaded by evil. They have been exploited in order to cause destruction to themselves and society.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A number of religious scholars in Afghanistan also condemn killing of civilians in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attacks and call \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attacks against the Islamic teaching.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 [Shams Rahman Frotan, religious scholar, captioned] Those who kill Muslims for no reason commit the biggest sin. The punishment for the murderers is hell and this is what the holy Koran has clearly indicated.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 [Correspondent] The religious scholars believe that most of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attackers are trained and brainwashed in Pakistan. They believe that Pakistani scholars should also condemn \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attacks.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 [Sayed Rahman, religious scholar, captioned] We appreciate the grand mufti for his comments on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attacks and at the same time we urge Pakistani religious scholars to condemn \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attacks. As you know most of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attacks receive training in so-called Islamic training centres in Pakistan and which makes cooperation of Pakistani religious scholars in ending \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attacks in Afghanistan is highly important.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 [Correspondent] Afghanistan is one of the countries with the highest number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attacks that mostly kill civilians.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the past the Taleban claimed that carrying out \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attacks against foreign forces in Afghanistan was lawful.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, now that the foreign forces are leaving, the Taleban are still carrying out \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attacks against the Afghan government forces and officials.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Mumbai rose by an alarming 12% in 2012 after witnessing a dip the previous year. A staggering 50% of those who took their lives in the city were younger than 30 and among these more than half were women, reveals the latest data of the National Crime Records Bureau. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A total of 1,296 people killed themselves in the financial capital last year, placing it fourth in the list of Indian cities with the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  incidence. Chennai led the death chart with 2,183 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , followed by Bangalore (1,989) and Delhi (1,397).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate (total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per lakh population) stood at 11.4 in 2012, a few points higher than Mumbai's 7 and a few points lower than Maharashtra's 14.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Generally, men accounted for more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths than women. The trend was true in Mumbai, where 59% of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims were men, and in Maharashtra, where 70% of the victims were males. Nationally too, the ratio of male to female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims was 66.2 to 33.8. An exception to the trend was the age group of up to 14 years; in Mumbai, thrice the number of girls in this age bracket killed themselves than boys.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Lakshmi Vijaykumar, who was responsible for the inclusion of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention in the National Mental Health Policy of India, said there is wide variation in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates within the country. "The southern states of Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate of more than 15, while in the northern states of Punjab, UP, Bihar and Kashmir, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is less than 3. This pattern has been stable for the last twenty years."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Vijaykumar added that smaller cities are worryingly catching up with metros in recording high \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates. "Also, the fact that 71% of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in India are by persons below the age of 44 imposes a huge social, emotional and economic burden on our society."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Family problems were revealed in the NCRB data to be the single largest factor driving people to end their lives. The factor was given as the cause of 40% \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -264 men and 262 women-in Mumbai and 26% \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  across the country. Major illnesses, such as cancer and AIDS, taken together constituted the second biggest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cause-causing 28% of the deaths-in Mumbai. They were followed by drug addiction (6.9%), failure in exam (4.5%) and love affairs (4.5%). Boys and girls alike took their lives over love affairs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Emotional reasons like failed marriage, relationship and love affairs drove most of the 534 female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Mumbai. By contrast, the causes of the 762 male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were economic, relating to poverty and employment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hanging emerged to be the most employed method to end one's life, with 917 of the 1,296 victims in the city using it. In Maharashtra, 7,055 people killed themselves this way. Self-immolation was the second most common \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  method in Mumbai and consuming poison the third. Surprisingly, only one person committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the city by coming under the train, though the figure for the category was 128 in the state.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A new report from the Utah Department of Health suggests the number of Utah \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  continues to climb, with preliminary data pointing to 500 deaths for 2011. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The year before, 456 Utahns died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  compared to 357 in 2006.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is one of those things that can be uncomfortable to talk about," Jenny Johnson, of the department's Violence and Injury Prevention Program, said in a news release. "But the data show this is an alarming problem in our state that we can't ignore any longer."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Though men between the ages of 25 and 64 make up 53 percent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths, more women attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than men. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Coalition has been formed to work to decrease \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides and suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts. A public awareness campaign will begin later this year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Help is available 24 hours a day at a statewide crisis line 801-587-3000 or the National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention LifeLine at 1-800-273-TALK. More information is also available at:www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 THE TABOO against reporting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has been lifted in extensive new guidelines released to the print media today by the Australian Press Council. The journalistic euphemism for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - "police said there were no suspicious circumstances" - may fade away now that the new guidelines acknowledge that reporting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be of public benefit. The guidelines, which are binding on about 98 per cent of Australian newspapers and magazines, including The Age, urge journalists and editors to publish only after seeking permission from family or friends, and only in ways that do not encourage copycats.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Now that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are frequently first reported on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter, Press Council chairman Professor Julian Disney said there is a greater need for the mainstream press to provide balanced, responsible reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to counteract early speculation. "The likelihood that people will find out about a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  through social media is very, very high," Professor Disney said. "This highlights the need for the mainstream media to be engaged in responsible reporting." The new guidelines spell out the council's concerns about giving reports of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  undue prominence through "unnecessarily explicit headlines or images" and requires that contacts for 24-hour support services be printed alongside references to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Terms such as "died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " or "took his life" are recommended instead of "committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ", which the guidelines note may sound like a crime. There may be occasion when the method or location of a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  may be reported if "the public interest in doing so clearly outweighs the risk, if any, of causing further \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ". Mental health reform advocate Professor Patrick McGorry, the 2010 Australian of the Year, welcomed the changes, saying: "It's great to see the Press Council say there is a positive benefit to reporting it [\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ]. That's never been said before." Professor McGorry has long campaigned for wider public discussion of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and has suggested that newspapers print a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  toll similar to the road toll. In December, the Senate report The Hidden Toll also called for national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  figures to be released publicly. "If you have too much inhibition, if you can't tell the story, you can't get the message across," Professor McGorry said. Barbara Hocking, executive director of SANE Australia, who also consulted on the new guidelines, said that the media must remember the impact of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reports on vulnerable or suggestible readers. "Every time there's a story on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , it brings it up . . . not everyone is robust when reading these stories." Ms Hocking denied SANE ever wanted a blanket ban on reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . "That part was interpreted by busy media professionals, who said 'OK, let's not go there', but we said, 'Yes, please go there'." The Age's code of conduct stipulates that we shall not publish information about individual cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unless it is justified by the wider public interest. The code also requires that care be taken when reporting methods of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and that, wherever possible, public information on where to gain help should accompany such reports. For help or information, visit beyondblue.org.au, call \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Helpline Victoria on 1300 651 251, or Lifeline on 13 11 14. The guidelines can be read at presscouncil.org.au

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ISLAMABAD, May 21 -- Marriage is a major source of stress leading to high psychiatric morbidity and suicidal behaviour among Pakistani women, says a leading psychiatrist of the country.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Studies show high incidence of common mental disorders, deliberate self harm and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among women, especially young married women. And the reasons for it are early age at marriage, lack of autonomy in choosing male partner, pressure to have children, especially male ones, early, economic dependence on husband, domestic violence and joint family system. Under these conditions, young married women's position is severely compromised, making them very vulnerable to psychiatric morbidity and suicidal tendencies," said Professor Dr. Murad Moosa Khan, of The Aga Khan University, Karachi at a Shifa Hospital seminar here.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr. Murad said there's an urgent need to have a national programme to address high prevalence of psychological distress and suicidal trends among young married women. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to him, the country doesn't collect \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  numbers and therefore, it is rarely taken into account when global \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  statistics are compiled or prevention programmes planned.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He, however, said independent estimates put the annual number of those committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at 6,000 to 8,000, of those attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at 60,000 to 160,000 and of those thinking of committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  600,000 to 800,000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There're around 100 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ideation, 10 to 20 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt and one \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  committing cases a year," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The psychiatrist said most of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases were reported in Sindh (52%), followed by the Punjab (38%) and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan (5%) each.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said police underreported true frequency of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "None of the 91 Rawalpindi \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reported by newspapers and NGOs in three months of late were reported by police," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr. Murad said most of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases were triggered by domestic disputes (45%), followed by financial problems or joblessness (37%), failed love affairs (7%), mental disorders (6%), illness (0.8%), exam failure or studies (0.5%) and other reasons (9%).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occurred in young people (single men and married women) under the age of 30 years. He said more men committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than women.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The psychiatrist said of the men committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , 51% were married, 44% single and 5% widower or divorced, while 60% of the women, who ended their life themselves, were married, 35% single and 5% widower or divorced.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said majority of the people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by hanging (39%), followed by poisons including insecticides and pesticides (25%), firearms (14%), drowning (10%), self-immolation (6%), jumping from a height (4%) and others (2%), adding medications for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  make up a few cases only.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to Dr. Murad, since \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and deliberate self-harm are illegal acts, people keep them secret for fear of harassment by police and stigma and in this way, their incidence are grossly underestimated.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, he said around 34% of Pakistani population suffered from common mental disorders and depression was implicated in over 90% of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases and therefore, the issue should be needed to be addressed at the community level.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Ideally mental health and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention programmes should be integrated within the primary health care system." The psychiatrist also called for early repeal of deliberate self-harm and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  related laws so that people wanting psychological help could do so without fear of being persecuted by police.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said better socio-economic policies, increased spending on mental health, creation of health facilities and countrywide public awareness campaign would contribute to helping suicidal people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He also urged the government to begin collecting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  mortality statistics through a standard system of registration, recording and diagnosis at town/city, district and provincial levels.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Information obtained can be used for epidemiological-analytical, intra-country and cross national studies. A mandatory reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  mortality statistics to WHO will improve data collection and surveillance on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On this occasion, Shifa Hospital's Consultant Psychiatrist Dr. Abdul Wahab, Director of Emergency Room Dr. Abdul Salam and Senior Medical Officer Dr. Assad Nabi besides doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists and medical students from the twin cities attended the seminar.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The average Malayali is famously private but might this unwillingness to let it all hang out be the reason for Kerala's frightening statistical success at family \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ? An abnormally high number of families commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , together, in the state. Family \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is defined as the dominant person in the family killing the others before doing away with themselves. Sometimes , it features a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  pact among family members.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A study by the Kerala State Mental Health Authority (KSMHA) says that 39 of every 100 family \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reported across India, take place in God's own country. The study has just been endorsed by Kerala's Economic Review 2010, which was tabled in the assembly. In 2009, there were 13 family \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Kerala, which totalled 38 deaths. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kerala also has the highest rate of individual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in India, after Sikkim. In 2009, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  accounted for nearly 40% of all deaths in Sikkim, in Kerala it was 25%.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Why is this so? Most Malayalis blame "family trouble" . They are somewhat in tune with the rest of the nation . The national average of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  caused by "family trouble" is 23.7%; while in Kerala it was 40.2%.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Unsurprisingly, the state's mental health authority expressed concern about rising family discord. Its study said,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "In Kerala, the basic economic and social needs have been taken care of but emotional and other forms of pressure take their place, sometimes with lifethreatening effects."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Rajesh Pillai, director of the Kochibased NGO Maithri, which offers emotional support to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -prone , corroborates the findings . "The calls that we receive suggest most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are triggered by relationship troubles," he says. At least some of this is brought on by the typical Malayali's unwillingness to talk about his problems and that's on account of his ego, Pillai adds.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But there is more. The spurt in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is also driven by weakening social institutions such as the family , rising divorce rates, unemployment , alcoholism, violence against women and children and consumerism . Taken together, this
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 cocktail can push people into debt and depression and eventually \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But D Rau, secretary of the KSMHA, explains it differently. "That is the police's way of explaining the problem. In clinical cases, most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are a result of mental illness. At least one of the parties will have some form of psychological problem ," he says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Studies on the social impact of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on Kerala society have thrown up an alarming fact. Most people who end their lives do so in their most productive years - between the ages of 30 and 45. Their dependents find themselves abandoned and vulnerable to the same escape route.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The other statistic, which has not yet been analysed in detail, is failed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts. According to Pillai , while 24 people on average commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Kerala every day, the number of attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is at least 10 to 15 times higher. "Many cases are not reported because the families would rather that hospitals write them off as accidents," he says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 KSMHA data did show a decline in the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Kerala over a longer period - between 2003 and 2009 - from 30.8 persons per lakh to 25.5 per lakh. But, compared to 2008, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rose in 2009 at the rate of 0.3 persons per lakh.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kerala's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  chart also illustrates the theory that money can't buy happiness with Malappuram, which is at the lower end of the human development index, recording the fewest cases.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 September 3, 2009 (Jackson, MS) - \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a preventable tragedy that is becoming a silent epidemic in Mississippi. Out of the 392 reported deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2007 in Mississippi, 50 of those deaths were young adults who felt so hopeless that they decided to take their own lives. In partnership with the Mississippi Youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Council, the Mississippi Department of Mental Health's (DMH) goal is to bring attention to youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  during National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Week, September 6-12. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be prevented especially if people understand the facts, warning signs and know how to get help. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Here are some facts about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 :
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Most people who are having thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are undecided about living or dying. It is important to help a person who is having thoughts identify their reason for living.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Asking someone if they are thinking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  won't cause them to consider or attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Many times, people who are having thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are actually relieved that someone has recognized their warning signs and is concerned enough to ask.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 By arming Mississippians with knowledge about warning signs, we hope to make an impact to make an impact among the youth in our state. Warning signs are especially important for family and friends to remember. Warning signs include: withdrawal, personality and mood changes, problems concentrating, problems at school, lost of interest in activities, feelings of hopelessness, and changes in eating and sleeping habits. Young adults often give indirect verbal clues that they are considering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . They may make statements such as: "You will be better off without me" or "Pretty soon you won't have to worry about me."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "While adults may become quiet or depressed, many times teenagers seem irritable or depressed or aggressive when they are having thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," said Kris Jones, Director of Division the Division of Disaster Preparedness and Response. "Another sign parents often miss is when a teen becomes cheerful after a period of depression. While this may seem like a good thing, it could be that they have made a decision to attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and feel relieved or at peace because they are no longer struggling to make a decision."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Many parents think their child would never consider \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; however statistics show this just isn't true. In Mississippi, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the 3rd leading cause of death among young adults. The MS High School Survey for the Youth Risk Behavior (2007) reported that 13.4% of students seriously considered \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the past 12 months, and 10.6% of students made a plan about how they would commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the past 12 months.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If you know someone who is talking, writing or thinking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  acknowledge the problem, let your friend or family member know that you care and want to help and tell someone. Shattering the silence around \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the first step to preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . If you or someone you know needs immediate help, contact the National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Lifeline at 1 -800-273-TALK.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 NEW YORK
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ONE OF THE MOST PERVASIVE myths about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is that the rate increases during the holiday season. In fact, this is the time of year that the rate is lowest. This might be hard to fathom because this misconception has been part of our culture for a long time and continues to be perpetuated through the media. However, the truth is that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is actually highest in April and May. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dispelling myths and misconceptions surrounding \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is vital to prevention, so it is important to take this opportunity to discuss more  fictions and facts  concerning this issue.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fiction: People who kill themselves are selfish and weak.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: More than 90 percent of people who die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have an underlying mental illness, such as depression or substance abuse, at the time of their death. Sometimes these mental illnesses are recognized, but often they go unnoticed and untreated. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is not the result of selfishness or weakness, but the result of painful and debilitating illnesses that can sometimes be fatal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fiction: If someone wants to take his own life there is nothing anyone can do to stop him.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: Some people who kill themselves are conflicted about life or death. Others are suicidal because they want to end the pain caused by their mental illness. Depression is the most common mental illness associated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and may cause intense inner pain as well as physical ailments such as headaches, back, chest or stomach pain, insomnia, etc.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Early recognition and vigorous treatment of depression and other illnesses that may lead to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the best way to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . We must also eradicate the stigma that surrounds seeking help for treatable conditions.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fiction: \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  only happens to  other  families.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: Sadly, it is estimated that over the course of our lifetime, 20 percent of us will lose a family member to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and 60 percent of us will know someone who will take his or her own life. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cuts across all socioeconomic, race, age, and gender lines.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fiction: Teenagers and college students are the most at risk for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: While it is true that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the third leading cause of death among adolescents and young adults ages 15-24, and the second leading cause of death among college students, in the U.S. the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate actually increases with age. Men 75 and older are at the highest risk for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fiction: Asking someone if he is suicidal will put the thought in his head and could lead him to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: If your fear someone you know is depressed and suicidal, don t be afraid to ask whether he or she is considering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or even if they have a particular plan in mind. If they say they are considering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , do not try to argue them out of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Instead, be direct, listen and let them know you care, that depression is treatable and that problems can be solved. If \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  crisis is imminent, take your friend or loved one to the emergency room or call 911. The national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention lifeline (800-273-TALK) is another resource for crisis situations.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A PERSON takes their life in Monash every three weeks, new figures show. Melbourne-wide it's one a day, with desperate calls to helplines on the rise. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Figures obtained from the State Coroner show 395 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  across Melbourne in 2005-06.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The highest toll was 24 in outer southeastern Casey, followed by 22 in the Yarra Ranges.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The figures, which record where a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occurred, rank Monash 12th in Victoria with 16 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Glen Waverley-based Wavecare counselling director Ray Paterson said two to three Monash residents were referred to the service each month after contacting Lifeline.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Paterson said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was a constant issue in Monash and because of the confidential nature of counselling, the number of residents seeking help could be higher.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The mental health charity SANE says that for every person who takes their own life another 30 attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Experts said socioeconomic levels, drug and alcohol abuse, life circumstances, mental health problems and ''copycat'' behaviour were among factors that led to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Australia chairman Michael Dudley said men in lower socioeconomic groups, in rural or remote areas or from indigenous backgrounds had higher rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''Men about 25 to 44 account for about 50 per cent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  annually,'' Dr Dudley said. ''People often think \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is best for their family and they'd be better off without them, which is a huge tragedy.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 University of Melbourne psychiatry Professor Tony Gorm said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in men over 80 were also high.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Helpline Victoria took 14,073 calls in 2005-06, with 9 per cent of callers at ''high risk'' of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -related calls to the SANE helpline have risen 50 per cent in the past year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mental Health Minister Lisa Neville said an action plan, Next Steps, aimed to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and self-harm in at-risk groups.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Survivors of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  (or SOS) has been created to meet weekly, addressing the needs of family members, friends and others who are dealing with the loss of someone they know to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The support group's first meeting took place on Oct. 4.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to SOS material, the support group is intended to help participants confront and work through difficult personal questions such as "How can I heal?", "Could I have done anything to prevent the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ?" and "Can I face the holidays?"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "While time is an important factor in any healing," the SOS release asserts, "time alone is not enough when trying to understand the issue of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 - The highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is for 65+, white males: 29.0 per 100,000

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 National health authorities are moving to allocate a larger budget to the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  policy sector beginning next year, hoping to reduce the nation's soaring \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 South Korea's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate has risen to the highest level among countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, with 24.7 out of every 100,000 people committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2005.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The increasing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Korea have become a pan-national issue that should be tackled together by all sectors of society," said Choi Hee-joo of the Health and Welfare Ministry policymaking bureau. "The government is planning to increase the budget to combat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , to come up with separate measures for different age groups starting next year." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Korea currently has the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate among the 30 member countries of the OECD, followed by Hungary (22.6 persons), Japan (20.3 persons) and Belgium (18.4 persons).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 1982, Korea's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate stood at merely 6.8 persons per 100,000, one of the lowest levels in the OECD, along with Mexico, Greece and Spain. Since the 1980s, however, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Korea have shown a sharp increase, rising by an annual average of 5 percent.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  now stand as the No. 4 cause of death in Korea with 14,000 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases in 2005, meaning an average of 38 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per day that year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although the government mapped out new measures in 2005 to reduce the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate to about 18 per 100,000 by 2010, experts have been pointing out the need for a more effective plan, attributing the soaring rate to complex social factors, including weaker mental health.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Growing numbers of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among teenagers and 20-something-year-olds are seen as a big problem in Korea.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Over 300 teenagers committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2005 and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  became the No. 1 cause of death for 20-something-year-olds, according to Seoul National University Bundang Hospital research.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 About 12 percent of college students in Korea currently suffer from depression and 89 percent of them answered that they felt like killing themselves more than once.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Online \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  websites are seen as one of the main reasons for the sharp increase, especially among the emotionally vulnerable younger generation. First appearing around 2004, these websites share information on "successful ways of committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " and help people plan joint \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Last year, the government set up a separate organization, the Korea Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention, to deal with the growing number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to KASP's survey last year, 47 percent of teenagers and 38 percent of the 20-somethings said that they have visited such websites out of pure interest. Over 20 percent of the two age brackets said that they had been tempted to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  afterwards.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Easy access to toxic chemicals is seen as another cause. Potassium cyanide, which is used frequently in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is banned from public access under the law, but can easily be purchased on the black market.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Health Ministry has been moving to tighten regulations of online sales of toxic chemicals as part of its \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention plan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On Friday, the KASP held its first international forum to discuss the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  issue in Korea and neighboring countries.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "More strategic plans are needed to sufficiently tackle the matter," said Hong Gang-eui, the president of the KASP. "Because the form and cause of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is different between the genders and different age groups, separate measures should be set up."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The overall \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in Ireland of roughly 12 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths per 100,000 people is by no means exceptional by international standards. According to the latest World Health Organisation (WHO) figures, it puts Ireland ninth in the European Union rankings, and 37th of 87 countries surveyed by the UN body.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What meagre comfort this might bring, however, is dissipated when male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates are taken in isolation. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Among men aged 25-34, Ireland has the second-highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in the European Union, with 34.6 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 in 1996. Only Finland had a higher proportion of such deaths. In the same year Ireland had 25.4 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 among men aged 15-24, giving it the third-highest ranking in that category for Europe by the WHO.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ireland also has the second-highest male-female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ratio in the EU, with 5.5 male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to one female. Only Greece, with a female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate of just one death per 100,000, has a lower ratio.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The WHO figures are far from perfect as, due to difficulties in collating data, different base years are selected for different countries (1996 is chosen for Ireland as the last census took place then). The figures do, however, give an indication of how Ireland's recent experience in the area differs from that of its neighbouring countries.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Between 1955 to 1995 the overall \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate here rose fivefold from 3.7 to 17.9 per 100,000 people. The Netherlands saw the next-biggest rise in the EU, with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates increasing by about three-quarters over the same 40-year period. Rates fell in Denmark and Portugal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The recent surge in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among young men has brought Ireland closer to the norm for northern and western Europe, where \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates are highest for young men and older people. Southern and Mediterranean Europe tend to have lower rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in all categories, while the world's highest rates are found in eastern Europe.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the WHO, Lithuania, with an overall \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate of 44 per 100,000, and a male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate of 71.1 cases per 100,000 in 1997, has the highest incidence of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per capita in the world. It is followed by Russia (37.7 cases per 100,000 overall) and Belarus (35 cases per 100,000).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In only three countries - Kuwait, Sao Tome and China - do female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per capita outnumber those for men.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In total, at least one million people throughout the world kill themselves each year, according to the WHO. This means one \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every 40 seconds.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Within the EU, about 43,000 people die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year, and more than 700,000 attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Partly in response to growing concern about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates, the WHO is devoting its annual World Health Report this year to mental health.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 By MARTIN THOMAS THE director of the nation's first \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  research
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 centre yesterday criticised Australia's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention efforts,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 condemning research as unfocused and existing strategies as
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ill-informed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pierre Baume said that despite escalating \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates, which were
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 among the highest in the Western world, little or no research was being
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 conducted into groups which were most at risk.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Prof Baume said a national database on attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had to be
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 established in Australia. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said a key failing to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  research was the fact that there
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 was no collection of data on attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by hospitals in
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Australia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ""This information would allow us to develop better, more effective
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 strategies," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Professor Baume said the national database must be developed in a
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 way that ensured that privacy was protected.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ""In 1994 (the latest figures), 455 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 cent more people attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," Professor Baume said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 1993, 367 people in Queensland committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . In 1992 there
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 were 428 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Professor Baume said a person who attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was 60 per
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 cent more likely to again attempt to take their life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Family members left grieving after \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  death were 10 times more
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 likely to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ""It is critical that we start to pay far more attention to these
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 people in our research in order to combat what is one of the major
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 public health problems facing us today," Professor Baume said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Professor Baume is an associate professor at Griffith University
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 and a former Australian representative on a United Nations' \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 prevention strategy group.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Yesterday he was named the foundation director of the new
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Australian Institute for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Research and Prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It has received funding from the Queensland Government.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The new institute will be based at Belmont Private Hospital, in
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Brisbane's east.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Queensland has a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate which is 20 per
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 cent higher than the national average.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is one of the highest in the Western
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 world _ higher than the United States and double that of Japan. The
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the Aboriginal community is twice the national
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 average.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Professor Baume said there had never been a specialist research
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 centre to examine the problem of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ""We have had a lot of band-aid solutions in the last 10 years. The
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 result is that the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has continued to increase," he
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ""A lot of previous preventative strategies have been uninformed by
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 research and, in fact, some have ignored research altogether."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Professor Baume said many of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  preventative programs in
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 operation had not been evaluated.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said the effectiveness of organisations
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 such as Lifeline _ a privately run 24-hour counselling telephone
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 service _ were not known.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ""I am not criticising Lifeline . . . but it is difficult to
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 evaluate the service.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ""We really don't know whether such a service has an effect,"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Professor Baume said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ""It is very critical that if we are to tackle the leading causes
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that we have concentrated research."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Professor Baume said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was not a new phenomenon.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What was new was that in Australia the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in people
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 younger than 30 had tripled in the past 30 years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The causes were complex, but had been related to unemployment, the
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 lack of support services and, in many cases, broken relationships.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ""Over 50 per
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 cent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Queensland were within one month of a

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ONE out of every four people who attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has a family member who also tried to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a study sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health has found. The number is higher than previous estimates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In previous studies, about one in 14 people who attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had relatives who had also tried to kill themselves. The new study involved 2,304 Los Angeles residents; the earlier estimates were based on interviews with mental patients and their families. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The chief investigator in the new study, Dr. Susan Sorenson, a psychologist at the University of California at Los Angeles, said she believed that the new study offered a more realistic view of the incidence of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts because it looked at the general population. She said previous studies were limited in scope.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr. Sorenson said that having a family history of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was not, in itself, a predictor of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  But mental illness can promote clusters of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts in families, she said. One's own mental illness, the mental disorder of a parent or a parent's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can contribute to a person's sense of social isolation, she said.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  studies have consistently found that women have a higher rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts than men. In the new study, women were four and a half times as likely as men to attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Dr. Sorenson said. Unmarried women with a history of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the family were at a higher risk for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts than men or married women.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr. Sorenson said future research would focus on the nature of the family's response to the attempt and to factors that might make members of such families more prone to social isolation and to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort --
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Department of Defense is fighting against \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and gaining ground. Defense officials told the Associated Press that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the Marine Corps has decreased 11 percent this year. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Marine Corps continues to push back against \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by training individual Marines in prevention techniques.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can happen to anyone," said Jeanette Smith, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention specialist for the Tri-Command. "It can strike all races, all genders, all ages. It's very important to be aware of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention techniques, especially evidence-based \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention tools."
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention education teaches Marines how to help a Marine in distress. The key word for Marines is RACE - recognize, ask, care and escort. Training covers everything from possible signs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to available prevention resources.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It gives them the knowledge to handle a distressing situation," said Smith. "Everyone should know how to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , not just for your fellow Marines, but also for yourself. Every Marine, every spouse, every family member is important to the Marine Corps."
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can affect families, friends, unit morale, cohesion, even unit readiness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The bottom line is we have to take care of each other," said Smith. "You spend more time with each other than with your families . Who better to keep an eye on you to make sure you're okay than your fellow Marine?"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ideally, prevention is continuous. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention is not just a class or training, but a proactive strategy to maintain readiness, morale and well-being. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  training is frequent, focusing on peer-to-peer support, intervention and getting help early.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Smith recommends following up annually required \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention training with supplemental education from a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention specialist, and keeping the discussion open by talking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the office.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I don't want any parent or any Marine to feel that pain of losing a Marine or losing a family member," said Smith. "We need to lead from the front with prevention, because prevention saves lives.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The earlier you get a person into treatment, the more successful the outcome will be. Your life is your life. Value your life, and value yourself. The Marine Corps wants you to get help."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The following prevention resources are available for free: Chaplains, Marine Corps \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Program, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-TALK), Behavioral Health Counselors 843-228-6126/1620, Military and Family Life Counselors 843-340-2589/843-592-2075, Military OneSource, and the National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Hotline (1-800-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 SUICIDE)\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 W e have a policy at this newspaper, and so do most newspapers, about not reporting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as news events. There are a few exceptions, including: A \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that happens in a public place with several witnesses. When a homicide investigation concludes with a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ruling, we conclude our reporting with that, as well. We report if a famous person or prominent figure kills himself or herself. When a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  loved ones become advocates, we often write about what drew them into the cause.   
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's a policy crafted out of well-meaning concerns. There are the families' almost universal wishes for privacy, and a fear by mental health experts that such reporting will fuel copycat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

There are a few exceptions, including: A \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that happens in a public place with several witnesses.

We report if a famous person or prominent figure kills himself or herself. When a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide's\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  loved ones become advocates, we often write about what drew them into the cause. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's a policy crafted out of well-meaning concerns. There are the families' almost universal wishes for privacy, and a fear by mental health experts that such reporting will fuel copycat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is common but often kept quiet, said Bill Rodstrom of the Humboldt County Department of Health and Human Services.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's much more common than homicide," he said. "You don't see it on the front pages, though. It doesn't say that in the obituary, that he took his own life." 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the 11th-leading cause of death in the United States. More than 30,000 Americans kill themselves every year. Every 18 minutes, someone dies by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , states the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There are three \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for every two homicides, and twice as many deaths due to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as to AIDS.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The National Institute of Mental Health estimates between eight and 25 attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for every death; the rate is higher in women and youth and lower in men and the elderly.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Look at the coroner's list of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for 2005 and you'll encounter a mix of ages, towns of residence and income brackets.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In January 2005, for example, four county residents killed themselves: a 23-year-old Arcata man with a history of depression; an 86-year-old Manila widower with prostate cancer; a 62-year-old Eureka woman who'd previously attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; and a 36-year-old Loleta man who'd been accused of molestation, according to the coroner's office notes. Of the four, only the Eureka woman left a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  note.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And it's a regional phenomenon. The second-highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in the County Health Status Profiles is Shasta County, with 20.3 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 people. Del Norte, Lake and Trinity counties are among the counties with high rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths, but unreliable statistics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There were 27 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Humboldt County in 2004, 31 in 2003, 28 in 2002 and 27 in 2001. Each year, women were a minority -- a total of 24 women out of the 143 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  over the last five years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that men are four times more likely than women to die from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but women report attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  about three times as often as men.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This year's 30 people ranged in age from 20 to 91. Locally, middle-aged men are more likely to kill themselves. Nearly one-third of local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims -- eight this year and 40 over the last five years -- were men between 45 and 60.

The next highest metropolitan area was Harris County, with 10.5 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 residents. The rate for the entire state was 10.8 per 100,000.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's not a significant difference because two out of 100,000 people more commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Travis County but because, over the last five years of analyzing this data, it averages out to two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per week," said David Evans, executive director of the Austin Travis County Mental Health Mental Retardation Center. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the report, men were nearly three times more likely to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than women in Travis County. And \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates were the highest -- with 21.7 per 100,000 residents -- for people between the ages of 65 and 74. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It is definitely time for us to step up to the challenge to see what we as a community can do," said Merily Keller, co-chairwoman of the Texas \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Community Network, whose son committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2000. "Talking about it doesn't cause \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Talking about it is how we prevent it." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Austin \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Coalition presented an Austin/Travis County Plan for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention to the Mayor's Mental Health Task Force and the Austin Travis County mental health center at a news conference Wednesday. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The proposal urges the mayor's task force and the mental health center to work with coalition to establish a panel of experts to study Austin's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate and develop a plan to lower it. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We have to make sure we don't lose sight of mental health, and in that mental health arena, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has to be discussed," Mayor Will Wynn said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The group could not cite a specific reason for the city's higher \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate, but John Hellsten, an epidemiologist with the Texas Department of State Health Services, said that a number of things that make Austin attractive, such as a highly educated population or a high rate of people moving into the area, are also associated with higher \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  risks. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Evans said that in order to lower the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate, an extra effort has to be made for people to get care for mental illness. With varying insurance coverage and private and public care facilities, the system can be very confusing, he said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The multiple funding sources, the multiple places for treatment and the minimal resources are often mismatched on any given day," he said. "The promise of this prevention plan is to work together community-wide."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SRINAGAR, Aug. 14 -- The conflict-torn Kashmir valley has witnessed 1482 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in past six years, official data reveals.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These figures are about only the cases that were reported while the unreported ones go undocumented. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At least 263 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2013, the official document of police department says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Official data reveals that 278 committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2012 while as 270 committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2011.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 2010, when Kashmir witnessed five-month long spiralling street protests resulting into killing of 117 youth in security forces action, the Kashmir valley recorded 250 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Similarly, in 2009 as many as 233 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  while as 188 tried to end their life in 2008.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The increased incidence of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , particularly among the Kashmiri youth, has become a serious concern for the people, and parents in particular.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And this year too, so far the incidents of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is refusing to show any decline, which certainly is and should be a matter of grave concern for all. On Sunday it was reported that two youth of Khanyar and Sopore have commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , which has triggered apprehensions among the parents here.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Valley' noted psychiatrist, Dr Mushtaq Margoob, says that various researches have suggested that 90 percent of people who commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are mentally depressed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Last 24 years of turmoil in Kashmir are the main cause for mental disorders among youths, which often lead to suicidal tendencies among them," Margoob told The Kashmir Monitor.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said the actual rate is higher than what is being reported. "Because of the social stigma, people do not report \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts or death particularly," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Renowned educationist of the Valley, Prof. A G Madhosh, said one of the major causes of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the parental as well as peer pressure. "Those who attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are often pressurized at early stages of life," he says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Parental pressure, tough competition in studies and career, lack of moral and religious education are the main reasons for these suicidal attempts among youth, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Various studies have revealed that females outnumber males in attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Kashmir.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Noted sociologist Prof Bashir Ahmad Dabla had conducted a research where it was found that 62 percent of all the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the Valley involved females.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I did a research on 27, 00 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases and found that 62 percent of all the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the Valley involved females. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ratio is almost same in rural as well as in urban," Dabla said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said youth in the age group of 15 to 26 years were found to be mostly likely to end their lives.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 More people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  daily due to unrequited love or a failed affair than due to poverty , bankruptcy or unemployment in the country .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And not surprisingly , this is reflected in the maximum number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  recorded in the age group of 0-29 years, according to latest NCRB data. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the 2013 NCRB data, there are 12 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every day due to love affairs compared to five for poverty , seven for bankruptcy and six for unemployment. Love affairs have turned out to be third biggest killers after family problems and illness. This is reflected in the fact that as many as 135 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fall in the age group of 0-29.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The data shows that 89 people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every day due to family problems while 72 end their lives because of illness. Cancer has turned out to be the biggest reason for which most suffering from illness commit
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  followed by paralysis and AIDS.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the data, in 2013 781 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  due to cancer while 724 took their lives due to paralysis. AIDS, despite being the deadliest disease, pushed only 590 people to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It also fared better in terms of percent age increase in comparison to 2012.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While paralysis \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  grew by 35.1% and cancer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  recorded an increase of 33%, AIDS \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  clocked only 12.4% rise. Illness was the biggest reason driving people to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Punjab with 35% of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the state falling in such category . The data also show that as many as 86 people died due to heart attacks and epileptic fits in the country .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile, the quaint environs of Kerala and Puducherry do not seem to be spreading any joy within families. Both places were top of the heap in the category of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  due to family problems with over 50% of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attributed to this reason.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Debts stemming from participation in the government's rice-pledging scheme were not the major reason for the recent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of a number of farmers, according to the state mental-health agency. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Mental Health Department sent a team to investigate the causes of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of 13 rice farmers during the past few weeks.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Department deputy director-general Dr Panpimol Wipulakorn said the investigation found that nine of them had committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  because they owed a large number of informal debts. Three committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as they had been suffering from congenital diseases. The remaining farmer's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  could not be linked to the rice-pledging scheme.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We found that the main risk factors for committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were mental-health problems, physical ailments and family problems. Economic problems caused by large informal debts was also a main factor leading them to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," Panpimol said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The rice farmers who committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were aged between 40 and 60. Most had complained of feeling depressed and frustrated. Some had harmed themselves or tried to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on previous occasions.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a related development, the department found that about nine rice farmers among those protesting in front of the Commerce Ministry were at risk from suffering depression. The department has instructed protest leaders to keep a close eye on this group and provide them with counselling services.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Panpimol said the department had received many reports over the past few years about rice farmers committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  because of their crops being affected by natural disasters, and because of their large financial burdens.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 People are urged to keep a close eye on family members who may be at risk of committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Farmers should learn that all problems can be solved step by step," she added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Farmers who are prone to depression are at risk of committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and are advised to consult health volunteers or hospitals.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Panpimol said that according to the World Health Organisation, negative news reports were an additional factor leading farmers to take their own lives. t0.000Most of people have succeeded in committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  because they wanted to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .t2.000
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "When [at-risk people] receive a lot of information about others committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , it puts them at [greater] risk of committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," she said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The city witnessed 712 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  last year - a grim fact that led Connecting NGO to undertake an ambitious programme to reach out to survivors of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts. This year, World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day will be observed on September 10 with the theme Stigma, a major barrier to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data shows there were 712 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Pune last year, while WHO estimates that nearly nine lakh people worldwide commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every year, including 1.7 lakh in India. The Lancet study further indicates that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has become the leading cause of death among Indian youth.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After a rise in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the increasing number of calls registered with its helpline number, Connecting decided to conduct a slew of programmes on the occasion to drive home the point that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be prevented. "It is estimated that the number of people who attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are approximately 10 times the actual deaths. Also, those who have attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are at much higher risk to make further fatal attempts," said Bobby Zachariah, CEO of Connecting. He said stigma is attached to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and people do not speak about suicidal thoughts for the fear of being judged. When a person commits \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the family undergoes a range of feelings that include shame and stigma, which often prevent them from seeking the support they need. People who survive a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt, too, find it tough to face their loved ones.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It is here that we want to reach out to survivors and support them. We also plan to visit families that do not know how to deal with the trauma of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by their loved one," says Zachariah.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The helpline numbers of Connecting 18002094353 (toll free) and 9922001122 receive at least 250-300 calls every month. "We often have callers who exhibit a sense of hopelessness, feel their problems are huge, often have eating or sleeping disorders and feel withdrawn from society. The helpline numbers give them a chance to vent out their feelings," he added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On September 10, the NGO will conduct two events where volunteers will distribute leaflets with a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention message and discuss issues related to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Consulting psychiatrist Dr Bhushan Shukla said he found several youngsters in his OPD with suicidal thoughts. However, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be prevented and there is a need for proper counselling and awareness, he said. Dr Kishore Gujjar, former president of Pune Psychiatrists' Association, said youngsters are more depressed and that a competitive lifestyle was to blame.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 BY one of those strange coincidences, the same day psychiatrist Kevin Malone testified to the Oireachtas Health Committee on abortion and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  this week, he also launched a major report on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among Irish males.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Malone is professor of psychiatry at UCD and a consultant psychiatrist at St Vincent''s hospital. He is an expert on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and its causes and he brought that expertise to bear at the committee hearings.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He expressed concerns about plans to include the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  grounds in the abortion bill. He told the committee of his fear that inclusion of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  grounds could help to 'normalise' ' \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and therefore drive up rates in society as a whole. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This would impact disproportionately on young males because young males are the most likely in the population to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As he wrote in an earlier submission to the Health Committee: "Based on my research ... there is a greater likelihood that this legislation may contribute to an increased risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Irish males through foregrounding 'suicidality' ' within the State for females, consequent to this legislation - an amplified cultural \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  signal through a normalisation effect. A similar increase in non-pregnant young females may also be a consequence."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "  To put it in layman's terms, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  begets \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . There is a copycat effect. The report on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among Irish males that Prof Malone launched highlights the fact that young men often commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 'clusters'. '.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This is why we have to be extremely careful how we talk about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . It''s all very well to be open about the problem, but if we are open in the wrong way, we can inadvertently cause yet more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . And if we give the impression that suicidal feelings are perfectly understandable in a given set of circumstances - for example, if a woman is confronted with an unwanted pregnancy - we can drive up the rate through the "amplified \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  signal" Prof Malone refers to.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This is why the heroic example set by Donal Walsh was and is so important.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As we know, Donal was diagnosed with cancer aged 12 and died earlier this month aged 16.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 By his own account, going into hospital for cancer treatment was like going into a version of hell. Suicidal feelings in this situation would seem understandable to some people but Donal completely rebelled against such thoughts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We cheered Donal for showing such courage in the face of adversity and for turning his situation into a life-affirming message, an anti-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  message. But it is also clear that our society is deeply conflicted on the topic of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and is therefore sending out mixed messages.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Recently, when Marie Fleming lost her case before the Supreme Court to have a constitutional right to assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  recognised, we sympathised with her.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At a human level, this is perfectly understandable. She is in the advanced stages of Multiple Sclerosis and is suffering greatly. But it was easy to turn this natural sympathy into support for assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to be recognised in law.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SO, on the one hand, we sympathise with Donal and applaud his anti-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  message and on the other hand we sympathise with Ms Fleming and her campaign.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sympathising with the suffering of another human being is natural but that sympathy can end up being used for contradictory purposes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One way of reconciling the contradiction is by resorting to the ideology of choice. If it was Donal''s choice to live on in the face of his suffering, then we can applaud that choice. And if it is Marie''s choice to end her life rather than endure suffering, then we should applaud that choice.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But this doesn''t really reconcile the contradiction because we have to decide whether \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is desirable or not from a societal point of view.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If we say that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is sometimes understandable, then we cannot but drive up the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What worries Prof Malone is that all the talk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in connection with pregnancy broadcasts a terrible signal to society that will be picked up by those at risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and will increase the risk of them committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . A debate about assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is bound to have the same effect.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 So, what Irish society is doing is lamenting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and also talking it up. Supporting a right to assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  normalises \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . A law that legitimates feelings of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in pregnant women does the same.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A society that intentionally or unintentionally legitimates \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can''t even pretend to be pro-life, either of the unborn or the born.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The HSE is running a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Awareness training course in Carrick-on-Suir over the next month.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The course will take place at the Nano Nagle Community Resource Centre, Greenside over three successive Monday nights.    
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The first session on Monday, September 17 will be facilitated by John, Kennedy, Training/Development Officer at the South East Region \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Resource Office. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It will start at 7pm with the first hour focussing on providing an overview of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , myths, motives and self harm.     
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The second hour will include an attitudes workshop followed by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  risk factors, warning signs and indicators.    
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The session will close with questions and answers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The second session on Monday, September 24 will be a three and a half hours \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  alertness programme called Safe Talk. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The session, which will commence at 6.30pm, will prepare participants to be \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  alert helpers during which you will learn how to provide practical help to persons with thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .   
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Participants should expect to leave Safe Talk more willing and able to perform an important helping role for those with thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Opportunities to help a person with thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are sometimes missed, dismissed and avoided.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 By attending Safe Talk, you will want persons with suicidal thoughts to invite your help and you will learn the TALK steps (tell, ask, listen and keepsafe) and will be able to activate a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  alert.   
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As part of the Keepsafe steps, you connect persons with thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to persons trained in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  intervention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At the Safe Talk session, participants expect to be challenged, expect to have feelings and expect to be hopeful.    
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Participants will see powerful reminders of why it is important to be \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  alert.              
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They will ask questions, enter discussions, learn clear and practical information on what to do and practice the TALK steps.   
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The second session concludes with practice in activating a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  alert and is also facilitated by John Kennedy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The concluding session of hte course on Monday, October 1 from 7pm to 9pm deals with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bereavement and will be facilitated by HSE \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Resource Officer Sean McCarthy.    
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has been described as one of the leading public health challenges facing Ireland.    
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For each individual who dies by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  there are at least six people that are significantly impacted by the death.    
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Workplaces, organisations and communities are also impacted upon as people and professionals find it difficult to engage with the bereaved, therefore missing an opportunity to provide support to them.   
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This workshop is targeted at providing information to people that will empower them in helping people and communities that have been bereaved through \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  So McKinley's act and McKinley the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  give us an opportunity to speak about the unspeakable.

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  Our state has one of the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in the country. Last year, 940 Coloradans killed themselves, according to the state health department. It was the highest rate since 1988. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ranked 7th as a cause of death in Boulder County.
\par \pard 
\par \pard 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  A truly fascinating study published five days before McKinley's death explores the high prevalence of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the intermountain West. The American Journal of Psychiatry report showed that the risk for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  increases by nearly one-third at an altitude of 2,000 meters, or approximately 6,500 feet above sea level.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  In 2006, the latest year for which national data was available, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, and Oregon accounted for nine of the 10 highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in the country.

\par \pard 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  We also have higher rates of gun ownership -- guns are used in half of all U.S. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  -- and lower population density, two factors also linked to higher \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates. Mental illness is a large factor, bigger than guns: The American Foundation for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention said 60 percent of people who commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  suffer from major depression prior to the act.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SUICIDE\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  leaves a lot of unanswered questions but Mental Health Minister Lisa Neville yesterday set about finding some answers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To mark World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day the Bellarine MP opened a community forum in Melbourne to arouse discussion on the issue. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a complex issue with tragic consequences and we can't afford to ignore it,'' Ms Neville said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''Each \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and each attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has tragic consequences in terms of the mental and physical scarring of survivors, and for their family, friends and work colleagues.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Each year 500 Victorians take their own lives with the highest rates among males and the 25- to 44-year-old age groups.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For every male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  there are about 30 to 50 attempts while for every female death there are about 150 to 300 attempts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Representatives from the State Government, beyondblue, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Association, as well as people touched by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , attended the forum.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said the meeting was aimed at equipping people with the skills to identify early warning signs of depression.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''It's about where we want to target \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ,'' she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''We want people to be able to talk about depression and how they feel so we can try and prevent the tragic consequences of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ''We want the broader community to be alert to it whether that be the football coach or the primary school teacher. Everyone has a role to look out for warning signs.''
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has touched many Geelong families, Ms Neville said, with rural communities often having high \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates. Figures from the Victorian Coroner's Office show the Barwon region registered an average of 11.4 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for every 100,000 people during 1991 and 2001.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Corio averaged 5.9 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a year, Greater Geelong 5.2 and South Barwon 4.4.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Opposition mental health spokeswoman Mary Wooldridge said World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Day was an opportunity to ignite change in the system so people with depression could access services. Figures showed one in 10 diagnosed with a mental illness commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  within 10 years of being diagnosed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 THOSE experiencing personal problems can telephone Lifeline on 131 114, SANE Helpline on 1800 187 263 or the Victorian \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Helpline on 1300 651 251.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is common but often kept quiet, said Bill Rodstrom of the Humboldt County Department of Health and Human Services.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's much more common than homicide," he said. "You don't see it on the front pages, though. It doesn't say that in the obituary, that he took his own life." 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the 11th-leading cause of death in the United States. More than 30,000 Americans kill themselves every year. Every 18 minutes, someone dies by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , states the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There are three \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for every two homicides, and twice as many deaths due to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as to AIDS.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The National Institute of Mental Health estimates between eight and 25 attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for every death; the rate is higher in women and youth and lower in men and the elderly.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Look at the coroner's list of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for 2005 and you'll encounter a mix of ages, towns of residence and income brackets.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In January 2005, for example, four county residents killed themselves: a 23-year-old Arcata man with a history of depression; an 86-year-old Manila widower with prostate cancer; a 62-year-old Eureka woman who'd previously attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; and a 36-year-old Loleta man who'd been accused of molestation, according to the coroner's office notes. Of the four, only the Eureka woman left a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  note.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And it's a regional phenomenon. The second-highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in the County Health Status Profiles is Shasta County, with 20.3 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 people. Del Norte, Lake and Trinity counties are among the counties with high rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths, but unreliable statistics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There were 27 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Humboldt County in 2004, 31 in 2003, 28 in 2002 and 27 in 2001. Each year, women were a minority -- a total of 24 women out of the 143 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  over the last five years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that men are four times more likely than women to die from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but women report attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  about three times as often as men.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This year's 30 people ranged in age from 20 to 91. Locally, middle-aged men are more likely to kill themselves. Nearly one-third of local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims -- eight this year and 40 over the last five years -- were men between 45 and 60.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Travis County has the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate among Texas metropolitan areas, according to a report released Wednesday by the Austin \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Coalition. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 More than 450 people, or 12 out of every 100,000 Travis County residents, committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  between 1999 and 2003, the report says. The next highest metropolitan area was Harris County, with 10.5 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 residents. The rate for the entire state was 10.8 per 100,000.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's not a significant difference because two out of 100,000 people more commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Travis County but because, over the last five years of analyzing this data, it averages out to two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per week," said David Evans, executive director of the Austin Travis County Mental Health Mental Retardation Center. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the report, men were nearly three times more likely to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than women in Travis County. And \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates were the highest -- with 21.7 per 100,000 residents -- for people between the ages of 65 and 74. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It is definitely time for us to step up to the challenge to see what we as a community can do," said Merily Keller, co-chairwoman of the Texas \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Community Network, whose son committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2000. "Talking about it doesn't cause \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Talking about it is how we prevent it." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Austin \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Coalition presented an Austin/Travis County Plan for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention to the Mayor's Mental Health Task Force and the Austin Travis County mental health center at a news conference Wednesday. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The proposal urges the mayor's task force and the mental health center to work with coalition to establish a panel of experts to study Austin's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate and develop a plan to lower it. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We have to make sure we don't lose sight of mental health, and in that mental health arena, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has to be discussed," Mayor Will Wynn said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The group could not cite a specific reason for the city's higher \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate, but John Hellsten, an epidemiologist with the Texas Department of State Health Services, said that a number of things that make Austin attractive, such as a highly educated population or a high rate of people moving into the area, are also associated with higher \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  risks. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Evans said that in order to lower the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate, an extra effort has to be made for people to get care for mental illness. With varying insurance coverage and private and public care facilities, the system can be very confusing, he said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The multiple funding sources, the multiple places for treatment and the minimal resources are often mismatched on any given day," he said. "The promise of this prevention plan is to work together community-wide."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Why do the media and the general public persist in perpetuating the stigma associated with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by the language we use -- \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombs kill 35 children, Oct. 1? Those terrorists who kill innocent people by blowing themselves up should be called murder bombers, not \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombers. Their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is only incidental to their murderous act and their association with those who die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as the result of a brain disorder only adds to the anguish of those who have lost a loved one to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Similarly, the use of committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  associates this sad final act of a troubled person with criminal behaviour. Since 2002, the Canadian Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention has advocated the use of "died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " or "died of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " consistent with the non-judgmental language we use for other deaths, died of cancer, died of a gunshot wound, died in a car accident.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This simple change of language would do much to de-stigmatize this desperate act and ease the grief of loved ones left behind.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Thank you to the Post-Gazette for starting a discussion of depression in the Aug. 13 article "Depression: A Disease That Conceals Hope." The article discusses the recent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of Robin Williams and the connection to depression. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The article has many good clinical spokespersons on the topic of depression. I noted a missing specialist in the area of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The need to understand \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is important for everyone because of the myths involved.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Myth: People who take their own life are selfish, cowards, weak or are just looking for "attention."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: More than 90 percent of people who take their own life have at least one and often more than one treatable mental illness such as depression, anxiety or bipolar disorder.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Myth: Teenagers and college students are the most at risk for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate for this age group is below the national average. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  risk increases with age. Currently, the age group with the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in the United States is middle-aged men and women between the ages of 45 and 64. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is still highest among white men over the age of 65.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: In 2011 (the most recent year for which data are available), 39,518 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were reported, making \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  the 10th leading cause of death for Americans.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: Research has shown that the risk for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be inherited.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: About one-third of people who took their lives did not communicate their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  intent to anyone.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These statistics come from the American Foundation for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention (www.afsp.org).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In addition, a second organization is the American Association of Suicidology (www.suicidology.org).
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a serious public health problem that takes an enormous toll on families, friends, classmates, co-workers and communities, as well as on our military personnel and veterans.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As a professional and a family member who lost a loved one to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , I would ask the Post-Gazette to continue this discussion now on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ATLANTA (AP) - More adults in the Midwest and West have suicidal thoughts than people in the rest of the country, but Rhode Island leads in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts, according to the first government study of its kind. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study, released Thursday, presents a different look at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in America - one that focuses on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the planning stages.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This report highlights that we have opportunities to intervene before someone dies by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  We can identify risks and take action before a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt takes place," said CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden, in a statement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Overall, the Midwest and West had significantly higher rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  contemplation than the South and Northeast. Researchers say they don't have any data to explain why some states or regional were different than others.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Utah had the highest rate of serious thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  (1 in 15 adults) while Rhode Island was at the top of the range for planning a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  (1 in 36) and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts (1 in 67).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Georgia was at the bottom of the range for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  thoughts (1 in 50), planning a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  (1 in 1,000) and, along with Delaware, for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts (1 in 1,000).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   The number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in India in a year has risen 400 percent in 50 years and the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate per 100,000 population exceeds 11 percent, a study said Wednesday. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has increased from 33,625 in 1964 to 134,799 in 2013, which is a 400 percent increase in 50 years," Mumbai-based NGO Vaastav Foundation said in a statement, Times of India reported.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 September, 10 is observed as World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day every year to highlight the alarming increase in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Its paper "Explorative study showing Indian \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates reported over 50 years" said the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 population has increased from 7.1 percent to 11 percent during this period and the highest of 11.4 percent was in 2010.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Quoting the National Crime Record Bureau reports, the NGO said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in India is treated as a crime rather than as a mental illness, which creates hurdles in getting emergency relief for victims.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It said the total number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has decreased overall from 135,585 in 2011 to 134,799 in 2013 but at the same time, there has been an increase of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by males from 87,839 to 90,543 during this period.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The total number of women committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was 47,746 in 2011 and 44,256 in 2013 with a significant 9.5 percent decrease in the married women category from 32,582 to 29,491.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The gender ratio within the married category points that more than twice the number of married men (64,098 in 2013) committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  against women (29,491 in 2013), the study said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It attributed family problems and illness as the main reasons for committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , with the two accounting for 25 percent and 20 percent of total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "India should have a national strategy for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention in line with 28 other countries that have successfully implemented it," Vaastav Foundation president Amit Deshpande said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Bangalore-based Child Rights Initiative for Shared Parenting (CRISP) president Kumar V. Jahgirdar told IANS: "It's a shame that maximum \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of the world occur in India. It's also more unfortunate that married men are committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  due to domestic violence. It's mainly due to gender-biased family laws."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0       "The number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has increased from 33,625 in 1964 to 134,799 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 in 2013, which is a 400 percent increase in 50 years," Mumbai-based NGO Vaastav Foundation said in a statement,Times of India reproted.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       September, 10 is observed as World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day every year 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 to highlight the alarming increase in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       Its paper "Explorative study showing Indian \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates reported 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 over 50 years" said the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 population has increased from 7.1 percent to 11 percent during this period and the highest of 11.4 percent was in 2010.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       Quoting the National Crime Record Bureau reports, the NGO said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 in India is treated as a crime rather than as a mental illness, which creates hurdles in getting emergency relief for victims.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       It said the total number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has decreased overall from 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 135,585 in 2011 to 134,799 in 2013 but at the same time, there has been an increase of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by males from 87,839 to 90,543 during this period.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       The total number of women committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was 47,746 in 2011 and 44,256 in 2013 with a significant 9.5 percent decrease in the married women category from 32,582 to 29,491.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       The gender ratio within the married category points that more than twice the number of married men (64,098 in 2013) committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  against women (29,491 in 2013), the study said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       It attributed family problems and illness as the main reasons for
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , with the two accounting for 25 percent and 20 percent of total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       "India should have a national strategy for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention in line with 28 other countries that have successfully implemented it," Vaastav Foundation president Amit Deshpande said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       Bangalore-based Child Rights Initiative for Shared Parenting (CRISP)
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 president Kumar V. Jahgirdar told IANS: "It's a shame that maximum \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of the world occur in India. It's also more unfortunate that married men are
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  due to domestic violence. It's mainly due to gender-biased family laws."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Thank you to the Post-Gazette for starting a discussion of depression in the Aug. 13 article "Depression: A Disease That Conceals Hope." The article discusses the recent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of Robin Williams and the connection to depression. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The article has many good clinical spokespersons on the topic of depression. I noted a missing specialist in the area of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The need to understand \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is important for everyone because of the myths involved.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Myth: People who take their own life are selfish, cowards, weak or are just looking for "attention."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: More than 90 percent of people who take their own life have at least one and often more than one treatable mental illness such as depression, anxiety or bipolar disorder.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Myth: Teenagers and college students are the most at risk for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate for this age group is below the national average. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  risk increases with age. Currently, the age group with the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in the United States is middle-aged men and women between the ages of 45 and 64. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is still highest among white men over the age of 65.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: In 2011 (the most recent year for which data are available), 39,518 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were reported, making \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  the 10th leading cause of death for Americans.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: Research has shown that the risk for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be inherited.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: About one-third of people who took their lives did not communicate their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  intent to anyone.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These statistics come from the American Foundation for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention (www.afsp.org).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In addition, a second organization is the American Association of Suicidology (www.suicidology.org).
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a serious public health problem that takes an enormous toll on families, friends, classmates, co-workers and communities, as well as on our military personnel and veterans.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As a professional and a family member who lost a loved one to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , I would ask the Post-Gazette to continue this discussion now on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We can try to empathize, but it is impossible for any of us to comprehend the devastating impact of death by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unless it has happened within our own family or community of friends. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The numbers, though, should be enough to make us all realize that death by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  must not be met with averted eyes and silence.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Consider that, on average, in Hamilton, one person dies by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every nine days. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  kills more people in our city than car crashes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Consider that the International Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention (IASP) estimates one million people worldwide die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every year. That represents about one death by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every 40 seconds somewhere in the world. Yes, every 40 seconds.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Again, from the IASP, consider that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  takes more lives than homicide and war combined. These numbers do not include the staggering number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts that do not result in death.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Each number represents a real person. And each real person had - or has - an extended network of family members, friends, colleagues, all of whom deeply suffer the loss of a loved one.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A large part of the issue is the silence. Face it: \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a difficult subject to talk about. It is, for many of us, scary and difficult to comprehend. Despite years of effort, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  carries a strong stigma, as do the mental health issues often related to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Increasingly, those who have lost loved ones to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are choosing to advocate for public discussion of the issue. In theory, at least, more open discussion will lead to more strategies for raising awareness of an uncomfortable subject and for developing more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategies.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Hamilton, open dialogue about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and mental health has been pivotal. For example, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Community Council of Hamilton works toward developing prevention strategies involving the partners that are involved in the council.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 COAST (Crisis, Outreach and Support Team) is a proven model in which a multidisciplinary team, including child and youth crisis workers, mental health workers, nurses, social workers and plainclothes police officers, reacts quickly to help people in crisis.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Not all efforts are large scale, nor do they need to be. Live Bravely, for example, is a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention and awareness program founded by Michael Lardie after a close friend's death by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . As The Spectator's Steve Buist reported this week, the program operates under the umbrella of services provided by Living Rock Ministries.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Today is World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, a day aimed at raising awareness of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and promoting dialogue about an issue that is too often blanketed by silence. We must stop being afraid to talk about it.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I support GP Ollie Bourke (June 16) in his call to break the silence surrounding \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's shocking that more people die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  annually than in road traffic accidents and homicides combined, and silence cannot be justified. There is plenty of noise on TV about preventing road, water and even ladder accidents but silence regarding \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the face of a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  epidemic, Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne wants to help. He cautions our high \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ranking could be because of differences in reporting in other countries and adds the Government is totally committed to addressing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 So, to me, crusty politicians don't make the cut, but the media does. It is the powerful shaper and marketer of ideas today. It also responds to public concern, as the depression campaign fronted by John Kirwan shows.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A similar campaign for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention would show youth that adults care. And the media isn't squeamish about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , as stories about lethally assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  show.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Bourke also sees hope in religion, as does a Health Ministry document on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention in 2005. It says religious affiliation and religious activity appear to protect against \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , with higher rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among those without it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Christian scholar Ravi Zacharias is one such example. As a teenager, self-rejection and alienation led to a failed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt placing him in a New Delhi hospital, during which time he found God. He celebrates the incredible worth God has placed upon his life.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SANGRUR: The number of farmer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Punjab seems to vary according to the source providing information about that. An NGO, Movement Against State Repression (MASR), has stated that Punjab is a glaring example of neglecting the factor of farmer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  when it comes to determining the amount of funds that should be spent on assisting agriculturists. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 MASR's convener Inderjit Singh Jaijee said, "As per information we collected, a Punjab police report says that only seven farmers committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from the period of 2002 to 2006."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 2008, state revenue department had mentioned in a report compiled on the basis of details provided by deputy commissioners that 132 farmers committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  during five years starting with 2002. Jaijee said Punjab Agricultural University's economics department team came up with a figure of 2,890 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from 2000 to 2008 in just two districts. It stated that in Sangrur and Bathinda, 1,643 and 1,247 farmers had committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , respectively.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 MASR claimed about 1,700 farmers committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from 1988 to 2008 in just two subdivisions of Sangrur district. "Going by that, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  figure across Punjab could be an estimated 20,000 in all these years," said Jaijee. A Punjab Farmers' Commission study had said that about 2,000 committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the state every year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ugrahan) has claimed more than 40,000 farmers committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in these years. Jaijee added, "Punjab has outclassed even Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh as data collected by MASR bares the truth on these \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . In Maharashtra, 34,659 farmers committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from 2000 to 2008 out of rural population of 5.58 crore. That comes to 62 farmer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per lakh population. Likewise, 18,396 farmers committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Andhra Pradesh which has a rural population of 5.54 crore. The figure of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per lakh there comes up to 33. As compared to highly farmer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -prone states, Punjab recorded 24,732 in eight years (as per NGO and farmer union figures, which have not been authenticated by state) in a rural population of mere 1.61 crore. That works out to 154 farmer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per lakh."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Farmer organization BKU's (Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri said, "Till now, Union government has meted out gross injustice to Punjab. That was proven when Punjab got just Rs 1,000 crore as assistance, when nationally, the figure was Rs 71,000 crore. That means a bit more than 1% of total assistance came the way of the state. Even if a parliamentary panel is formed, it will ignore Punjab."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ATLANTA (AP) - More adults in the Midwest and West have suicidal thoughts than people in the rest of the country, but Rhode Island leads in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts, according to the first government study of its kind. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study, released Thursday, presents a different look at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in America - one that focuses on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the planning stages.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This report highlights that we have opportunities to intervene before someone dies by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  We can identify risks and take action before a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt takes place," said CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden, in a statement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Overall, the Midwest and West had significantly higher rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  contemplation than the South and Northeast. Researchers say they don't have any data to explain why some states or regional were different than others.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Utah had the highest rate of serious thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  (1 in 15 adults) while Rhode Island was at the top of the range for planning a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  (1 in 36) and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts (1 in 67).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Georgia was at the bottom of the range for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  thoughts (1 in 50), planning a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  (1 in 1,000) and, along with Delaware, for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts (1 in 1,000).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 MUMBAI: There are many worrisome statistics in the National Crime Records Bureau report for 2009. Health problems and their related economic issues prompt 73 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  daily. Family problems and illnesses account for 44.7% of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the country. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although men are killing themselves in larger numbers than women, the statistics show that housewives, who were hitherto considered non-suicidal, are ending their lives. NCRB 2009 said that 223 Indian men killed themselves daily across the country. The corresponding figure for women was 125 daily, and 69 of these were housewives.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It is really worrisome to note that housewives are committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in such large numbers. The report says that one in every five \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is committed by a housewife,'' said psychiatrist Dr Harish Shetty. "When we were students we were told that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were confined to single people-now stress and the alienation brought on by liberalization policies are affecting everyone."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The crime report, which is the only document in India that provides statistics about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , concurs: "Social and economic causes have led most of the males to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  whereas emotional and personal causes have mainly driven women to end their lives."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Among metros, Bangalore recorded the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate with 2,167 people killing themselves in 2009. Chennai followed with 1,412, Delhi with 1,215 and Mumbai with 1,051 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Incidentally, Kolkata has the lowest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in the country.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Five states-Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh-have emerged as sensitive states for senior citizens, accounting for 54.7% \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims in the 60-plus age group. Maharashtra ranks third in this list, accounting for 11.2% \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The southern states add up to 39.2% of total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the country, with Puducherry having the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in the country at 47.2 suicidal deaths per one lakh population as against the national average of 10.9. Maharashtra's rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is 13.2.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lastly, experts pointed out that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are increasing rapidly and it is imperative for the government to treat the issue as a public health problem like malaria or polio. "Consider how the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has increased from 1,13,914 in 2005 to 1,27,151 in 2009, and it is indicative enough," said Dr Harish Shetty.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 More than 400 families and friends bereaved by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attended the vigil in Dublin, which was held at the Bank of Ireland forecourt at College Green.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The ceremony was marked with music, prayer and a minute's silence as those in attendance held their lit candles in memory of all who have died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Ireland.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Large numbers of people also attended commemorative events in Galway city and Letterkenny, Co Donegal, as this was the first year that vigils have been extended nationwide.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Television presenter and author Christy Keneally, who spoke at yesterday's vigil in Dublin, said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can affect any family.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Joe MacAvin, spokesman for Irish charity 3T's (Turning the Tide of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ), which organised the vigils, said the occasion was "a special night for families and friends who have been affected by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to honour their loved ones," particularly as new figures indicate that three out of four people know someone who has died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 3T's also took \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day as an opportunity to call on the Government to learn from other European countries in taking successful measures to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths through increased funding.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Many other countries have been successful in reducing deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , particularly in Finland, which has reduced \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates by 20 per cent in the last decade.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The lack of social support and a platform to express oneself are major factors for the worrying suicidal tendencies among Fiji s youths, says Margaret Logavatu of Partners in Community Development Fiji. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We are living in interesting times, she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The time for young people to be seen and not heard is long gone.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 With drug and alcohol abuse around they have become vulnerable as a society.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We should see them as potential contributors to society, she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If we as a society do not give them a platform to express themselves then they are prone to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  thoughts, she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ms Logavatu said the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in Fiji varied significantly in terms of racial background, age and gender.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 2006, the figures show the highest number of both attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were committed by Indo-Fijians, she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These figures show that 53 Indo-Fijians attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and 76 committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , in comparison to 14 attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and 10 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by Fijians in the same year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ms Logavatu said according to gender, the figures showed the same number of men attempted and committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at 47 attempts and 41 deaths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While in women the figure for attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was lower at 20 but deaths were high at 46, she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The breakdown into age brackets showed that the majority of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were committed between the ages of 17-25, with a total of 42 deaths in this category.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If the figures are accurate, then the most promising number is that overall deaths due to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have decreased from 2000 to 2007 from 105 to 67.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ms Logavatu said public awareness campaigns such as World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day on September 10, were aimed at helping to reduce the numbers further as more people became aware of the issue and how to get themselves or their friends and family the support needed.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 KUALA LUMPUR: The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate among Malaysian Indians, the third largest ethnic group in the country, is disheartening.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The rate of 30 to 35 per 100,000 committing or attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every year is three times the national average of 10 to 12 per 100,000 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  annually. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In comparison, psychiatrist Prof Dr T. Maniam said, only 15 Malaysian Chinese and six Malays per 100,000 commit or attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  annually.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Maniam, who is with Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia's Psychiatric Department, said there were no statistics for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in East Malaysia or among Orang Asli, but studies to determine the pattern would be conducted in future.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Though there was no single reason for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the common factors were mental disorders, depression, emotional stress, relationship problems and anxiety.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Other factors which come into play are poverty, physical abuse, alcoholism, drug abuse and unemployment," said Dr Maniam at a roundtable discussion on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  organised by the MIC's social arm, Yayasan Strategik Sosial at the party's headquarters yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said there was strong evidence that one way of reducing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was to reduce access to lethal means.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "A study in Sri Lanka where access to paraquat, a weedkiller which is commonly used in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , was made more difficult resulted in a drop in the number of cases."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He felt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  could also be reduced if the media stopped reporting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases in graphic detail.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The media has given some ideas of how to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to those in the same situation. Evidence shows that two to three per cent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are imitation or copycat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "People who are already disturbed or stressed might follow what they read or see in the media," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 MIC deputy president Datuk G. Palanivel felt early detection was crucial in preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said detection of suicidal tendencies could result in early intervention and thus reduce the problem among the Indian community.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We need to create an awareness on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . We also need to mobilise resources and employ the co-operation of all segments of society to eradicate this problem."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Palanivel said negative scenes in Tamil movies should also be reduced.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The movies sometimes glorify \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attach value to it, but for a depressed mind, it acts as a trigger for them to plan out their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Palanivel, who is also Deputy Women, Family and Community Development Minister, said the ministry was prepared to fund studies on the prevention of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the country.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The discussion was attended by representatives of non-governmental organisations, universities and colleges, religious bodies, Social Welfare Department and National Family Development and Community Board.

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 MEDIA organisations have urged MPs considering changes to the Coroners Act to relax outdated restrictions on the reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Legislation being considered by Parliament's justice committee to modernise the act retains the restrictions, which are based on the argument that silence would lead to fewer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Commonwealth Press Union told the committee that such thinking was flawed. The most recent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  figures, from 2002, show New Zealand has the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development for females aged 15 years to 24 years and the third highest for young men. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 CPU chairman and Dominion Post editor Tim Pankhurst said keeping the "veil of secrecy" in the face of such high \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates was not in the public interest. The media played an important role in informing and educating the public on matters of public interest and had a duty to do so.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Responsible reporting could lead to better understanding, more discussion of alternatives and perhaps a reduction in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates, he said. "Stories can address likely causes, warning signs, trends in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates, recent advances in treatment and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategies. Discussion may help destigmatise \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ." The CPU's media freedom committee has worked with Government officials to develop protocols on reporting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in a restrained manner.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The New Zealand Press Council said there had been greater social pressure for more information about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in recent years and the press had a crucial role in any public debate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Its submission said it subscribes to the philosophy of the Canadian \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Information and Education Centre that: "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  affects us all. Let's talk about it."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Council member Terry Snow said euthanasia could be debated publicly without social pressure or concern and it supported the media in wanting to have the same openness regarding \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I don't think any problem was ever solved by not talking about it."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Society had become less tolerant of drink-driving and sexual abuse, which was now more openly discussed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The link between reporting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and copycat deaths was tenuous, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Annette Beautrias of the Canterbury \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Project said there was clear overseas evidence that proved the link. She gave several examples that pointed to increases in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  after media reports, especially when the mode of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was detailed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Wellington coroner Garry Evans -- who this week suggested that teenagers might be resorting to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  because an over-protective society has shielded them from life's problems -- said if publishing restrictions really were effective, it would be expected that New Zealand would rank lower than countries with no restrictions.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He agreed the mode of death should continue to be suppressed but was in favour of greater openness in media coverage and a better understanding of the factors involved in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 AFTER discussions between media groups and the Government, Canterbury University's Jim Tully has created draft protocols that would bind media organisations to:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Report \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in straightforward manner by providing concise and factual information to increase public awareness of risk factors, warning signs and actions to help a suicidal person.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Avoid simplistic explanations of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , which is usually complex and seldom the result of a single event.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Avoid presenting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as a method of coping with personal problems.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Avoid focusing only on the deceased's positive characteristics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Avoid language, images or presentation that glorifies, trivialises or romanticises \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or persons who commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Avoid unnecessary reference to details of method or place of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Avoid speculation especially surrounding celebrities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Take into account the impact of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on families and other survivors.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 MONTREAL - A surprising discovery by neuroscientists links epilepsy to depression and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The brain dysfunction underlying epilepsy may also determine whether people are at risk for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , lead researcher Dale Hesdorffer of Columbia University in New York explained Tuesday in a study published online in the journal Annals of Neurology.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "For reasons that are not understood, depression both increases the risk for developing epilepsy and is also common among people with epilepsy who experience many seizures," Hesdorffer said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hesdorffer's team looked at data from 324 people in Iceland with epilepsy and 647 without the disorder.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's a common assumption that difficulties living with epilepsy could lead to depression, and in some cases, an increased risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . But researchers were surprised to find that epileptics are four times more likely to have attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  before ever having a seizure, even after taking into account other factors such as drinking alcohol, having depression, age and gender.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The study confirmed what scientists have known for awhile -- that people with major depression are nearly twice as likely to develop epilepsy as those without depression.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "But what has never been shown before is that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt is associated with an increased risk for developing epilepsy," Hesdorffer said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This may, in part, clarify the increased risk for completed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  observed in people with epilepsy."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That's because attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a known risk for further attempts, "some of which will unfortunately result in completed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," she added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While the study results suggests a common brain dysfunction might be responsible for epilepsy and suicidal behaviour, findings also point to different mechanisms behind depression and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The current study did not address those mechanisms. That's the next step, Hesdorffer said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 McGill University professor Gustavo Tureki, director of the McGill group for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  studies at the Douglas Hospital, which is researching the biological factors of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , called the study an important step forward.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Depression and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  often go together," Tureki said. But the Iceland study suggests that the association between epilepsy and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is not through major depression, Tureki said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The higher prevalence of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among epileptics was independent of the fact that they were also more likely to be depressed," Tureki said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Study results suggest clinicians need to ask epileptic patients about previous \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts, experts said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Professionals involved in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention should be aware of this information," said Louis Lemay, director of the Quebec Association for the Prevention of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A worrying number of men in their 30s are killing themselves even though overall figures are down.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 AUSTRALIA'S \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate has fallen steadily since peaking in 1997, but a disturbing number of men in their 30s are killing themselves, according to a Federal Government report. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fell to 2213 last year, about 100 fewer than the 2320 in 2002. Of the 2213, 78 per cent were men, according to the Bureau of Statistics. There was a decade-high \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  figure of 2720 in 1997.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For men and women, the highest rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was observed in the 30-34 age group. For every 100,000 people in this age group, 30 men and nine women committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  last year - a total of 297 people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The rate of teenage \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fell to its lowest in a decade, accounting for 12.7 males and 3.6 females per 100,000. The number of teenage \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  peaked at 154 in 1997, and fell to 113 last year. Less than 2 per cent of all deaths last year were attributed to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  continues to be a major public health issue," the report said. "The human and economic costs are substantial."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Beyondblue clinical adviser Ian Hickie said the reduction in teenage \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was comforting, but the challenge now was to target men in their 30s.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We've been preoccupied with youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and have had some emphasis on old people, but really the big group is men in the peak of their lives, and this should be an opportunity for us because the links between substance abuse and depression and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is much more clear-cut in midlife," Professor Hickie said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Australian Institute for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Research and Prevention's acting director Jacinta Hawgood said the national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategy appeared to have been effective in reducing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , particularly among teenagers. But White Wreath Association president Fanita Clark accused the Federal Government of underreporting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , saying "our figures, even last year, were probably about three to four times higher than what the Government quoted".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mrs Clark, whose organisation raises money to establish centres for the mentally ill, said the figures had been fudged to conceal a "depleted" mental health system. "People cannot receive any appropriate treatment, even after an attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," she said. "In most cases they're routinely refused hospital admission, only to complete the job."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 New Zealand's emphasis on preventing youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has been called into question by a report showing nearly 80 per cent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths are adults over 25.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a paper published in the New Zealand Medical Journal, the principal investigator of the Canterbury \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Project, Dr Annette Beautrais, said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategies had focused on New Zealand's high youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate but virtually ignored the problem of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in older age groups.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Despite the fact youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates are high, the fraction of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  accounted for by young people under 25 is a little over 20 per cent," she said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There is an urgent need to develop a national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention policy that is applicable to all age groups, and accords all age groups equal levels of care and protection."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Beautrais said males aged between 25 and 55 accounted for almost half of all New Zealand \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "So we need to focus on adults and particularly men in their middle years."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said continued claims that New Zealand had the highest rate of youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the world were not correct.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Latest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  statistics showed that youth (15-24) \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had dropped from 140 in 1998 to 96 in 2000. Young people still had high rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but the highest rate was now among those aged 25-29.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The total number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2000 was 458.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Beautrais said there was a public perception that youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  meant school-age children but they made up only 3 per cent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That perception had generated the idea that a school-based approach, such as the Yellow Ribbon Fight for Life programme, was the best approach, but she disputed that.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 New Zealand was one of the first countries to develop a national youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategy, she said. But it now lagged behind other countries in the area of adult and older adult \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ministry of Health spokeswoman Maria Cotter said the New Zealand Health Strategy 2000 recognised the need for an all-age-groups approach and the ministry would start work this year with agencies, including the Ministry of Youth Affairs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Beautrais said policies for adults and older people probably would need to place less emphasis on childhood, family and social factors and greater emphasis on mental health factors, particularly the role of depression.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That call is supported by Dr Alison Taylor, chief executive of the Mental Health Foundation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said the foundation would be encouraging mental health promotion and prevention rather than crisis treatment alone.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Peter Watson, director of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Information New Zealand, supported a strategy for all ages and said it was also important to address the issue of Maori \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates, which remained higher than non-Maori.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of a taxi driver who flung himself off Tsing Ma Bridge yesterday has raised fresh concerns about the numbers of people leaping to their deaths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Tong Ho, 36, jumped to his death at about 9.20am yesterday, a police spokeswoman said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "He parked his vehicle on the bridge and then climbed on to the rail and jumped," she said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  She added that another taxi driver had witnessed the incident and contacted police.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  It was later revealed that he had telephoned his brother to tell him he was going to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The man's body was found floating near Tai Lam at about 12.30pm, according to the spokeswoman.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "There was no \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  note and apparently he did not give his brother any reason for the decision to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," she added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Researchers and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  counsellors have highlighted the rising trend in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  jumps following the recent similar death of film star Leslie Cheung Kwok-wing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  In a statement on its Web site, the Hong Kong Jockey Club Centre for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Research and Prevention voiced concern about the negative influence that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of famous figures could have.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "If public figures solve problems by committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , people who are undergoing hardship may follow suit," it said. However, it said that no research had been carried out on the subject.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Asha Balani, director of the Samaritans' multilingual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  hot-line, said: "With everything that is happening, we do have people calling in who are very confused about the way things are going." She said people needed to offer each other support.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A 2000 study conducted by the Centre for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Research and Prevention found the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate had risen over the past two decades, and recorded that more men than women were likely to attempt to take their own lives. Jumping was the most common \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  method.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A 2001 report found charcoal burning was next on the list, and was especially common among middle-aged people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Samaritans' 24-hour \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  hotline number is 2896 0000.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  ONE in 14 young Australians have tried to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and more than one in three knows someone who have, but leading researchers fear attempts to fix the problem threaten to make it worse.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A federal government survey of more than 1200 people aged 14 to 24, released yesterday, identified common feelings of pessimism and powerlessness in young people's attitude to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Many saw \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as a young person's problem with one 16-year-old from Melbourne saying "teenage is \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , isn't it?"  Leading \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  researcher Pierre Baume warned that millions of dollars poured into \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention by government was having little effect on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates and could "actually take \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates up". Professor Baume, founding director of the Australian Institute for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Research and Prevention at Griffith University, said the report reflected the growing prevalence of suicidal thinking and behaviour in society and the need for further research to better target prevention programs. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Professor Baume said while the health of young people had improved in the past several years, a minority were at risk from self-destructive behaviour.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He said suicidal thoughts were prevalent in the community with some studies suggesting as many as seven in 10 high school and university students had such thoughts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We estimate in Australia that the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts is 40 to 60 times greater than the number of people who commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , which makes it about 150,000 who will attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every year," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "We are yet to see any \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention programs which have been put in place so far actually makes a difference and . . . to some extent some of the programs are actually taking \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates up.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "I think we need to take hold of what we do and start to do research to understand the phenomenon better before we start to spend millions of dollars of public money that may well end up being wasted and even push up \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates. We need to be cautious." The report, which included in-depth discussions as well as a national survey, was conducted as part of the National Mental Health Strategy by social research group Keys Young.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Releasing the report at the Pacific Rim Conference on Adolescent Health in Sydney, Government MP Brendan Nelson said the level of despair, anxiety and stress experienced by young people reflected a deeper malaise in society.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Many young people feel there's no space for them in society; they're having pressures put on them both materially and educationally and many feel they're not able to cope," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Almost one in three people had suffered depression, bullying or harassment at school, severe stress and anxiety.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  One in 10 had suffered physical abuse, 7 per cent took dangerous risks and 6 per cent had deliberately injured themselves. Such experiences were often associated with each other and with social disadvantage, such as leaving school early and being unemployed.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  PRISON OFFICERS are more likely to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  if their jails have a high \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate among inmates, according to an unpublished Home Office report, writes Marianne Macdonald.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The study of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among staff and adolescent offenders, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Attempts in Male Prisons, by Dr Alison Liebling of the Institute of Criminology, Cambridge University, is to be published next month. It shows staff \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have mirrored inmate \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at establishments such as Risley remand centre and Brixton prison, which have had two or three of each.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Home Office recently began recording prison officer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but has not yet released any figures. But Dr Lieblings's research suggests that half of all officers know colleagues who have taken their own life, and a fifth of all officers know of colleagues who have attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Her research reveals systematic concealment of prison \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides;\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  only two-thirds are named as such in coroners' records.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  ''Women were put in the no-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  verdict category, so were the young, those who had injured themselves several times before, those who had not hanged themselves and those who had been taking different types of medication,'' she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Instead, their deaths were recorded as misadventure or coroners recorded open verdicts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate of women in prison was equal to that of men. Women's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in the community was two-and-a-half times lower than in prison, which surprised the Home Office, she said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It turns out trying to keep up with the Joneses can lead to your own death.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The more money your neighbors make, the more likely you are to take your own life. These findings come from a new paper published at the San Francisco Federal Reserve titled "Relative Status and Well-Being: Evidence from U.S. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Deaths." According to the results, your risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  increases by 4.5 percent if your own paycheck is less than 10 percent of your county's average income. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Economists have long believed our financial happiness is linked to how our personal financial status compares to our peers'. Fed researchers published the paper in search of statistical evidence that provides this assumption. In past studies, academics relied on unreliable happiness surveys to find evidence of this theory. But this is the first attempt at using \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  data and comparing correlations with county income data.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What they found has stunning implications for how we view our personal finances relative to our peers. Here are some other interesting financial characteristics that can impact your risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Live in Beverly Hills and Your Risk of \cf17 Suicide\cf  Increases.\b0 \i0 \ul0  Moving on up to the West Side could mean you're increasing your risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . When considering the nation as a whole, low-income individuals tend to have a higher risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . This would lead you to believe that low-income counties have a higher risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , yet the Fed study shows the opposite.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Since high-income counties tend to have larger disparities in income, wealthier counties--not poorer--often see an increased risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  when factoring income of victims relative to their peers.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 People Out of Work Have Greater \cf17 Suicide\cf  Risk.\b0 \i0 \ul0  Next time you make your dreary pilgrimage to the office, you are doing more than collecting a paycheck--you are also decreasing your risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's not surprising to hear that those who are unemployed or unable to work due to disability face higher rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Those who are unemployed increase their risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by 72 percent. However, people who are retired or on leave also have a higher risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  compared to their working peers.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \cf17 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf  Rate Increases If You Make Less Than $34,000.\b0 \i0 \ul0  When looking at income levels and increased risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Fed researchers found that $34,000 is the tipping point for dramatic increases in rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Those who earn less than $34,000 see an increased risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of about 43 to 50 percent. Meanwhile, those with incomes between $34,000 and $102,000 increase their risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by only 10 percent.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Final Thoughts.\b0 \i0 \ul0  The Fed study is just one study in a body of research pointing to a link between happiness and how we measure ourselves to our peers. If the findings are true, then wealth is nothing more than feeling like you have more money than everyone else. Another way to think of it may be the more you compare your wealth to your neighbors, the harder it is to feel content with what you have. The secret to happiness might be ignoring the Joneses next door.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 DEAR ANNIE: On September 10th, people throughout the world will be observing World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, an annual event co-sponsored by the International Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention (IASP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is one of the leading causes of death in the world. Approximately one million people worldwide die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year. This corresponds to one every 40 seconds. The number of lives lost each year through \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  exceeds the number of deaths due to homicide and war combined. These figures do not include \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts, which may be up to 20 times the number of deaths. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The economic costs associated with self-inflicted death or injuries are estimated to be in the billions of dollars a year. The psychological and social impact of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on the family and community is staggering.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is good news, though. Organizations across the globe such as ours are making advances in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention research, understanding and outreach. Despite the complexity of this phenomenon, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be prevented. There are many crisis centers throughout the world that offer support by phone, email, forums and chat.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention organizations, locally and across the world, are joining IASP in encouraging people to "light a candle near a window at 8 p.m." on World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day -- Monday, Sept. 10 -- to show support for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, to remember a lost loved one and for the survivors of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Please ask your readers for their kind support in lighting a candle and, if they are in distress, to call a helpline or crisis center. This information can be found on our website atwww.iasp.info . Thank you. -- Lanny Berman, Ph.D., ABPP, President, International Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 DEAR DR. BERMAN: We appreciate the opportunity to tell our readers about World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day. We hope they will light a candle near a window (although please not near flammable drapes or blinds) and remember those who have died. We also hope those in need will check your website.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 DEAR ANNIE: I have been invited to the wedding of my co-worker's daughter, whom I have never met. My co-worker has made it quite clear that he is expecting us to attend. At his first daughter's wedding, he invited 20 co-workers and only one showed up. He was very upset.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Am I obligated to attend his daughter's wedding? -- RSVP
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 DEAR RSVP: You are not obligated to attend, although you might want to weigh that choice against Monday's reaction at the office. While we don't care for co-workers who pressure others to attend their personal events, consider whether he wants your presence or your presents. If you would feel more comfortable, send a small gift with your regrets.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 DEAR ANNIE: I was in a similar situation as "In the Middle." My grandmother also made me feel second best, and I often received gifts that were not age appropriate. Your suggestion that Mom stay out of it and let the now-adult granddaughter thank Grandma for any gifts and share what she chooses is sound advice. That is what my mother and I have been doing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I would like to mention another possibility. Perhaps the grandmother's upbringing and culture could be playing a part in her behavior toward the granddaughter, since it did in my case. In some cultures, the older generation is still having a difficult time making the transition from their traditional ideas. In realizing this, I have become more understanding about my grandmother's behavior and react with more compassion. She's trying her best. -- Been There, Too

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SHARP RISE REPORTED IN YOUTH \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 SUICIDES\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The rate at which teenagers and adolescents kill themselves has soared since 1980, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The increases were sharpest for young black males; the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate quadrupled among those aged 10 to 14. In the early-twenties age category, in which there was an overall slight decline, black males were the only group to go against the trend of declining \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates. The increase in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate was also very steep for white females aged 10 to 14. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Between 1980 and 1992, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates rose 28 percent among Americans 15 to 19, and 120 percent among those aged 10 to 14, the CDC said. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate fell 7 percent among Americans aged 20 to 24.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Although \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among children is a rare event," the report concluded, "the dramatic increase in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate among persons aged 10 to 14 years underscores the urgent need for intensifying efforts to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " in that age group.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Noting that the causes of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are "multiple and complex," the CDC said possible factors in the increased rate among young people include substance abuse, mental illness, family disruption, severe stress in school or social life, rapid social change and "increased access to firearms by the at-risk population."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among people under 25, nearly two-thirds (65 percent) were committed with guns. Hanging was the second most common method, and poisoning ranked third. Firearm-related \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  accounted for most of the increase in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate for teenagers between 1980 and 1992, the CDC reported.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After reviewing programs throughout the nation, the CDC said it has identified strategies for preventing youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . These include training teachers and school officials to identify young people at highest risk for suicidal thoughts and attempts, educating young persons about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and setting up referral programs and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  crisis hot lines.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  However, the rail safety board noted an "increasing trend in the number of public fatalities due to trespass or \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " over the past decade.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The number of reported \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on the rails in 2001-2002 was 192, but the number for 2014-15 is predicted to be 311.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  This is an 11 per cent increase on last year, when there were 279 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or suspected \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The number of people injured in failed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bids is also increasing, figures show.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Sue Royal, from the Samaritans, said that more than 7,000 rail staff have been trained to spot people in danger since 2010 and pointed out that railway \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "have remained relatively stable at around four per cent of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  nationally."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  She added: "Figures for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on the railways need to be looked at over the long term as the year on year numbers fluctuate."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The rail safety board pointed out that injuries or deaths to members of the public, rather than passengers and workers, was "not within the direct control of the railway".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Among the measures being introduced to try to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is blue lighting on bridges and platforms, as studies indicated this has a calming influence on people.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 to highlight the alarming increase in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Its paper "Explorative study showing Indian \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates reported
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 over 50 years" said the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 population has increased from 7.1 percent to 11 percent during this period and the highest of 11.4 percent was in 2010.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Quoting the National Crime Record Bureau reports, the NGO said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 in India is treated as a crime rather than as a mental illness, which creates hurdles in getting emergency relief for victims.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It said the total number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has decreased overall from
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 135,585 in 2011 to 134,799 in 2013 but at the same time, there has been an increase of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by males from 87,839 to 90,543 during this period.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The total number of women committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was 47,746 in 2011 and 44,256 in 2013 with a significant 9.5 percent decrease in the married women category from 32,582 to 29,491.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The gender ratio within the married category points that more than twice the number of married men (64,098 in 2013) committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  against women (29,491 in 2013), the study said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It attributed family problems and illness as the main reasons for
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , with the two accounting for 25 percent and 20 percent of total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "India should have a national strategy for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention in line with 28 other countries that have successfully implemented it," Vaastav Foundation president Amit Deshpande said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 IMPHAL, Sept. 10 -- As in other parts of the globe, the World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day was observed at the conference hall of the Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Medical Science under the aegis of Psychiatry department of the hospital today. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The day is observed annually on September 10 with the main objective to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and create awareness that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a major preventable cause of premature death.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This year's observation was held under the theme "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention: One world connected."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 JNIMS director prof M Shyama Singh, medical superintendent professor W Gopimohon Singh, HoD Psychiatry prof S Gyaneshwor Sharma attended the observation as chief guest, guest of honour and president respectively.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Delivering the key-note address at the event, senior resident, department of Psychiatry Dr Nelson Loitongbam said the first global \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  report was published on September 4, 2014 following a ten-year study in 172 countries.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report was published with the main objective of boosting the awareness level of the public regarding \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts and to make \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention a higher priority of the global public health agenda, he asserted.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The professor opined that the World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day has proved to be very successful in encouraging organisation worldwide to coordinate their efforts and learn from each other to assist those affected by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in making themselves heard during discussions related to the issue.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The most number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases have been reported from the South-East Asia region, with India accounting for the highest number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  overall in 2012 as per the World health Organisation's latest report on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , prof Gyaneshor said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the report, India contributes to more than 10 percent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the world with the youth (15-29 age groups) being the most vulnerable of which men are known to take their own lives more often than the women in the country, he continued.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In India, Puducherry has the highest rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with a staggering 36.8 per a lakh population followed by Sikkim (29.1), Tamil Nadu (24.9), Kerala (24.1) and Manipur (1.6), he added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He further expressed that the 2014 theme "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention: One world connected" reflects the fact that cooperation and connections are important at several levels to combat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as strong human bonds is crucial to individuals vulnerable to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  South Africa has the eighth highest rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the world, with approximately more than 8 000 people committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year, according to the South African Federation for Mental health. "Based on this, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the third greatest cause of unnatural death in the country. In South Africa alone, there are 23 completed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - almost one per hour - and 230 attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every day," the federation said in a press release today, World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the South African Depression and Anxiety Group (Sadag) one out of three \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in South Africa happen in Gauteng and a one and a half times increase in suicidal deaths have been seen in the rural Eastern Cape in the former Transkei over the past five years. Sadag says two thirds of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims are aged between 20 and 39 and there are 4.6 male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for every female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . According to Sadag there is an "increasingly concerning rate of teen depression and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ": 1 in 4 South African teens have attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and 1 in 3 hospital admissions for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  involve youth. Yet, most schools don't have counsellors or psycho-social support systems in place, the organisation says. Research has shown that there are many psycho-social factors that could play a role, such as untreated mental illness, substance abuse, family problems, trauma, rape and poverty, which all have the potential of contributing to a person feeling suicidal. The SA Mental Health Federation says about 70% of those that have committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  often give warning signs. "Some of the warning signs are; talking or thinking about death often, clinical depression, the loss of interest in things one used to care about, putting affairs in order, a sudden change in behaviour, unexpected switch from being very sad to being very calm or appearing to be happy, visiting or calling people to say goodbye and giving away possessions," the federation says. The World Health Organisation (WHO) have found in international studies that despite the alarming findings about the prevalence of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  all too often fails to be a prioritised public health problem globally and those that seek help at public health services are often not provided with effective and efficient help. According to SADAG 75% of South Africans will not get the mental health treatment they need.  More \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  facts: 10% of all non-natural deaths in adults and 9.5% in youth are due to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . +/- 23 a day, virtually one every hour. There were 4.6 male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for every one female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Less than 1% of mental hospital beds are for children and adolescence. 70% of South Africans who attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had a mental health disorder.  Source: Sadag

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 NEW DELHI: India has by far the largest number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the world, accounting for nearly a third of the global total and more than twice as many as China, which is second on the list. It also has the highest rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among young people, those aged 15 to 29 years. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These were among the sobering facts revealed in a report released by the WHO, "Preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , A Global Imperative". The report noted that an estimated 8 lakh \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths occurred worldwide in 2012. It is the second leading cause of death in 15-29-year-olds.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 India in 2012 had nearly 2.6 lakh \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , dwarfing China's 1.2 lakh. It's overall rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  (incidents per lakh population) was 12th at 20.9. The worst countries on this parameter were North and South Korea, Guyana, Lithuania and Sri Lanka. Hungary, Japan, the Russian Federation and Belarus also had higher \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates than India. The Scandinavian countries, Sweden, Norway and Denmark - often perceived as societies with high \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates - had much lower rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In richer countries, three times as many men die of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as women, but in low- and middle-income countries, the male-to-female ratio is much lower at 1.5 men to each woman. Globally, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  account for 50% of all violent deaths in men and 71% in women.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In India, the ratio was about 1.6 with close to 1.6 lakh men committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2012 compared to just under 1 lakh women. In four countries in India's immediate neighbourhood - China, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan - women outnumbered men among \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Only in Iraq and Indonesia was the proportion of women to men among those committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  higher than in these countries.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 India, despite its horrific statistics, has actually seen a decline in the tendency to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  since 2012, with the rate declining by 9.2% over this 12-year period. China, in the same period, saw its \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate drop by 59%.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 India is a clear exception to the global pattern of the 70+ age group having the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates. At 21.1 per lakh population, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among this age group are only about as common as among the entire population.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report revealed that ingestion of pesticide, hanging and firearms are among the most common methods of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  globally. It also listed various risk factors that contribute to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Risk factors associated with the health system and society at large include difficulties in accessing health care and in receiving the care needed, easy availability of the means for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , inappropriate media reporting that sensationalizes \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and increases the risk of "copycat" \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and stigma against people who seek help for suicidal behaviours, or for mental health and substance abuse problems.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Risks linked to the community and relationships include war and disaster, stresses of acculturation (such as among indigenous peoples or displaced persons), discrimination, a sense of isolation, abuse, violence and conflictual relationships.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Risk factors at the individual level include previous \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts, mental disorders, harmful use of alcohol, financial loss, chronic pain and a family history of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 More people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  daily due to unrequited love or a failed affair than due to poverty, bankruptcy or unemployment in the country. And not surprisingly, this is reflected in the maximum number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  recorded in the age group of 0-29 years, according to the latest government data. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the 2013 NCRB data, there are 12 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every day due to love affairs compared to 5 for poverty, 7 for bankruptcy and 6 for unemployment. In fact, love affairs have turned out to be third biggest killers after family problems and illness. This is well reflected in the fact that as many as 135 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fall in the age group of 0-29.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The data shows that 89 people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every day due to family problems while 72 end their lives because of illness. Cancer has turned out to be the biggest reason for which most suffering from the illness commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , followed by paralysis and AIDS.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the data, in 2013, 781 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  due to cancer while 724 took their lives due to pa
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ralysis. AIDS, despite being the deadliest disease, pushed only 590 people to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . It fared better in terms of percentage increase in comparison to 2012. While paralysis \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  grew by 35.1% and cancer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  recorded an increase of 33%, AIDS \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  clocked only 12.4% rise.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Illness was the biggest reason driving people to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Punjab with 35% of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the state falling in such category. Notably, Punjab has been severely affected by cancer and drug abuse in the recent past. The data show that as many as 86 people died due to heart attacks and epileptic fits in the country .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kerala and Puducherry were on top of the heap in the category of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  due to family problems with over 50% of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attributed to this reason.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Leader (May 29) had two items on the important issue of youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  What is of real concern to me is that I never hear calls for survivors of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to join those wanting to educate and dissuade people from committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I am a cancer survivor and that is highly respected in the community. Yet I am also a "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  survivor" and writing as such, I am not game to put my name to this letter.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Over and over I have confronted the severe torment of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  I have been hospitalised repeatedly in order to keep me safe in this world when I want to be gone, so that the suffering in my mind can stop. I hope and I plead with God not to be condemned.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I respectfully suggest that if we want the community, especially our young people, to learn more about what leads to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide;\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  what it may be like to be suicidal and considerations of ways to deter \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide;\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  people working in this area need to look to those who have endured skirmishes with desperate yearnings to be dead.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I recommend that "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  presentations" include either in person or in writing or at least in preparation, an account from a "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  survivor", whom you believe has insight into their life-and-death battles.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To begin with, people need to stop referring to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as doing "something silly" or "being selfish". We do not use these terms for those who die from other severe illnesses.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It may be necessary to confront the "copycat" element of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide, if suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is spoken about openly and this would need to be done in a careful way.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Remember, if you want to find out about what it is like to give birth to a baby, you would not rely on a male obstetrician for your information; you would ask a mother. If you want to work in the field of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, learn from those who are serious "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  survivors".

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Central Coast \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention awareness programs will be highlighted in an effort to curb an alarming spike in the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths over the past 12 months.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Figures from the Gosford Coronial Court show there were 43 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths last year, a significant increase on preceding years. St Vincent de Paul Society's Mental Health Project director Katie Sewell said she and GPs like Dr Lyndon Bauer from Ourimbah were concerned about the spike. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "In the late 1990s \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates were even higher, -exceeding 50 a year in some years, and a multi-strategic response coincided with a fall in the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths in the past decade," Ms Sewell said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In recognition of the high \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates on the coast in the late '90s, Premier Bob Carr launched the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Safety Network and both Dr Bauer and Ms Sewell believe the efforts and awareness that developed from this has been responsible for the lower rates seen in more recent years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We have to keep a close on those numbers and -remind everyone to be aware there are a lot of services," Dr Bauer said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ms Sewell agreed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Hopefully, an increase in prevention awareness can again reduce \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  death rates on the Central Coast," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Bauer reminded people of the importance of taking warning signs of suicidal thoughts seriously and help those people find their way to one of the many support services on the coast.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lifeline: 131 114, Kids Help Line 1800 551 800, Mensline Australia on 1300 789 978, Relationships Australia 1300 364 277, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Call Back Service 1300 659 467 the NSW Mental Health Line 1800 011 511.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Check for the warning signs Attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the biggest warning sign for possible future \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  death. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts are roughly equal between men and women, but \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths are much higher in males, with four or more males for every one female.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Men often choose more -violent ways to attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and are less likely to -access support services.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Common factors in the 43 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths on the coast last year included males -between 45 and 65, relationship and family issues, previous \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  act discussed with someone, -depression, financial problems, disability, physical or mental illness.The 2013 coronial data also showed more adults were using social media to express distress before death.

St Vincent de Paul Society's Mental Health Project director Katie Sewell said she and GPs like Dr Lyndon Bauer from Ourimbah were concerned about the spike. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "In the late 1990s \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates were even higher, -exceeding 50 a year in some years, and a multi-strategic response coincided with a fall in the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths in the past decade," Ms Sewell said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In recognition of the high \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates on the coast in the late '90s, Premier Bob Carr launched the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Safety Network and both Dr Bauer and Ms Sewell believe the efforts and awareness that developed from this has been responsible for the lower rates seen in more recent years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We have to keep a close on those numbers and -remind everyone to be aware there are a lot of services," Dr Bauer said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ms Sewell agreed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Hopefully, an increase in prevention awareness can again reduce \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  death rates on the Central Coast," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Bauer reminded people of the importance of taking warning signs of suicidal thoughts seriously and help those people find their way to one of the many support services on the coast.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Check for the warning signs Lifeline: 131 114, Kids Help Line 1800 551 800, Mensline Australia on 1300 789 978, Relationships Australia 1300 364 277, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Call Back Service 1300 659 467 the NSW Mental Health Line 1800 011 511.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the biggest warning sign for possible future \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  death. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts are roughly equal between men and women, but \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths are much higher in males, with four or more males for every one female.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Men often choose more -violent ways to attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and are less likely to -access support services.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Common factors in the 43 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths on the coast last year included males -between 45 and 65, relationship and family issues, previous \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  act discussed with someone, -depression, financial problems, disability, physical or mental illness.The 2013 coronial data also showed more adults were using social media to express distress before death.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 DEAR ANNIE: On September 10th, people throughout the world will be observing World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, an annual event co-sponsored by the International Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention (IASP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is one of the leading causes of death in the world. Approximately one million people worldwide die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year. This corresponds to one every 40 seconds. The number of lives lost each year through \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  exceeds the number of deaths due to homicide and war combined. These figures do not include \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts, which may be up to 20 times the number of deaths. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The economic costs associated with self-inflicted death or injuries are estimated to be in the billions of dollars a year. The psychological and social impact of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on the family and community is staggering.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is good news, though. Organizations across the globe such as ours are making advances in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention research, understanding and outreach. Despite the complexity of this phenomenon, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be prevented. There are many crisis centers throughout the world that offer support by phone, email, forums and chat.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention organizations, locally and across the world, are joining IASP in encouraging people to "light a candle near a window at 8 p.m." on World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day -- Monday, Sept. 10 -- to show support for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, to remember a lost loved one and for the survivors of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Please ask your readers for their kind support in lighting a candle and, if they are in distress, to call a helpline or crisis center. This information can be found on our website atwww.iasp.info . Thank you. -- Lanny Berman, Ph.D., ABPP, President, International Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 DEAR DR. BERMAN: We appreciate the opportunity to tell our readers about World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day. We hope they will light a candle near a window (although please not near flammable drapes or blinds) and remember those who have died. We also hope those in need will check your website.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 DEAR ANNIE: I have been invited to the wedding of my co-worker's daughter, whom I have never met. My co-worker has made it quite clear that he is expecting us to attend. At his first daughter's wedding, he invited 20 co-workers and only one showed up. He was very upset.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Am I obligated to attend his daughter's wedding? -- RSVP
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 DEAR RSVP: You are not obligated to attend, although you might want to weigh that choice against Monday's reaction at the office. While we don't care for co-workers who pressure others to attend their personal events, consider whether he wants your presence or your presents. If you would feel more comfortable, send a small gift with your regrets.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 DEAR ANNIE: I was in a similar situation as "In the Middle." My grandmother also made me feel second best, and I often received gifts that were not age appropriate. Your suggestion that Mom stay out of it and let the now-adult granddaughter thank Grandma for any gifts and share what she chooses is sound advice. That is what my mother and I have been doing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I would like to mention another possibility. Perhaps the grandmother's upbringing and culture could be playing a part in her behavior toward the granddaughter, since it did in my case. In some cultures, the older generation is still having a difficult time making the transition from their traditional ideas. In realizing this, I have become more understanding about my grandmother's behavior and react with more compassion. She's trying her best. -- Been There, Too

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 CHANGES in media guidelines on the reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have had little effect at a grassroots level, according to one of the Hunter's leading \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  experts. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Late last year the Australian Press Council released new guidelines acknowledging the reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  could be of public benefit.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Lifeline Newcastle and Hunter \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention manager Kate Munro said the media and the community still had a fear of talking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Hunter, northern and mid-west regions of NSW saw a spike of suspected \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at the end of last year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There were 53 reported cases during the Christmas period, compared to 29 for the same period in 2010.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ms Munro said talking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was important for prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We are not very compassionate with our behaviour," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is seen as a selfish act, but that's built on a myth."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategies aimed to break down communication barriers and talk safely about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "When someone has a heart attack, most people would help by calling 000 and giving CPR. Here at Lifeline, we train people in giving verbal CPR."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suspected \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are often linked to relationship breakdowns, social isolation and financial hardship.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ms Munro said people who had thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  often felt they were a burden on their family or the community.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I can't save every single person that has thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . But that motivates me to connect with as many people as I can," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ?? Lifeline's 24-hour crisis telephone line is 13 11 14.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SafeTALK aims to increase awareness of self harm and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Most people with thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  invite help to stay safe. Alert helpers are trained to know how to use these opportunities to support that desire for safety. A SafeTALK trained helper will become better able to: move beyond common tendencies to miss, dismiss or avoid \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; identify people who have thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; apply the TALK steps: Tell, Ask, Listen and KeepSafe; to connect a person with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  thoughts to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  first aid, intervention caregivers.  
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is one of the three leading causes of death worldwide for people between 15 and 45 years of age, according to the World Health Organisation. Ireland is little different. Last year, 527 deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were recorded and most were males in that same age group. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There must be raised public awareness too of the reality of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and that means talking about it more often and more openly," said Cathy O'Sullivan, Nurse Practice Development Co-ordinator for the Kerry Mental Health Service. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The SafeTALK training package involves powerful video clips, illustrating both nonalert and alert responses to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This short training provides all members of the community to be aware that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  exists in our community and provides them with the opportunity up skill themselves to be \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  alert helpers and it provides participants with the skills and tools to save lives," said Ms. O'Sullivan. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Anyone concerned about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  should contact the emergency services at: 999 or 112; Samaritans at: 1850 609090, 1Life at: 18002471000 or HSE helpline at 1800 742645. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pre booking is essential for attending SafeTALK. To book your place you're advised to phone 087 7553066.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Abandoning someone who is suicidal is not a good thing. Yet, that seems to have happened at the World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day ceremony in Guelph on Saturday. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Guelph supposedly has well regarded mental health and addiction facilities, services and professionals, but this was not evident at the ceremony. None of the communitys leading services - including Trellis Mental Health Services and Guelph General Hospital, which are on the front lines when it comes to dealing with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - participated in the event.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The ceremony was designed to bring discussion of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  into the open and, hopefully, help prevent future \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . But this citys major players in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention and treatment were not there. They gave up a perfect opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention and their support of those who struggle with suicidal thoughts, who have attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , or who carry the scars of a loved one who has died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Quite simply, the citys leading mental health services abandoned some of the communitys most vulnerable people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Resource Group of Wellington-Dufferin and Torchlight Distress Centre did a wonderful job organizing the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention day event in Guelph. It was a simple but sincere and moving ceremony that evoked both sad and cherished memories. More importantly, it promised hope for the future of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention. These groups understand the importance of talking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Others could learn from their example.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 An estimated 15 Guelph residents will commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the next 12 months. With a provincial election underway, we must make sure they get the care and services they need. Ask the candidates to make improved mental health a priority issue that crosses party lines.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Concerned citizens and local musicians are banding together this Saturday to Live4Life: Concert for a Cause - a series of concerts in four Halton venues.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This Saturday is World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day and Halton Region, along with the Halton \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Coalition (HSPC), wants to raise awareness of how real the issue of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is in Halton and to encourage those thinking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to reach out for help and not keep silent. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The HSPC is taking a new approach this year to reach out to the community with the first Live4Life: Concert for a Cause event.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The concert brings local bands together this Saturday in four venues across Halton: Burlington, Oakville and Acton. The artists and Coalition members hope to educate the public about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention and to destigmatize \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Halton.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We know that keeping silent about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is detrimental to our community. The stigma around \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  often keeps people with suicidal thoughts from openly talking with family and friends and from seeking help and support," Dr. Bob Nosal, Halton Medical Officer of Health said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It is also one of the biggest barriers in the grief process for survivors of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . I believe this concert is a wonderful way to help break that silence.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a real issue in Halton Region. According to local statistics:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 - each month, on average, more than two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths occur in Halton.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 - Halton Regional Police receives nearly one call per day related to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 - more than 420 people end up in Halton Region hospitals each year from attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Halton Region is a caring, compassionate community, and the volunteers of the Halton \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Coalition exemplify community coming together to make a difference, and hopefully save someone's life," said Halton Regional Chair, Gary Carr.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The concert brings local bands together this Saturday in four venues across Halton: Burlington, Oakville and Acton. The artists and Coalition members hope to educate the public about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention and to destigmatize \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Halton.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We know that keeping silent about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is detrimental to our community. The stigma around \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  often keeps people with suicidal thoughts from openly talking with family and friends and from seeking help and support," Dr. Bob Nosal, Halton Medical Officer of Health said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It is also one of the biggest barriers in the grief process for survivors of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . I believe this concert is a wonderful way to help break that silence.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a real issue in Halton Region. According to local statistics:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 - each month, on average, more than two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths occur in Halton.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 - Halton Regional Police receives nearly one call per day related to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 - more than 420 people end up in Halton Region hospitals each year from attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Halton Region is a caring, compassionate community, and the volunteers of the Halton \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Coalition exemplify community coming together to make a difference, and hopefully save someone's life," said Halton Regional Chair, Gary Carr.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A call by a coroner that the media end what he termed the "evasion" and "cover-up" of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has been challenged by Headline -- the agency which monitors journalism related to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and mental health. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Coroner John Cannon made his comments at an inquest into the death of a South African man who took his own life in Co Donegal last year.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Cannon described \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as a tragic phenomenon that mainly affected young men and suggested that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was becoming prominent in Ireland because deaths had not been given precedence in the traditional media. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the charity 3Ts (Turn the Tide of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ), more than 600 people in Ireland die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year with one in six \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  committed by males under 25, and almost one in four by men aged under 35.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Last month the Irish Property Council reported that 29 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  could be directly linked to the property and construction industry crisis.But according to Mr Cannon, who is coroner in Letterkenny, Co Donegal, deaths in road accidents are routinely given national news coverage -- often making the headlines. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "However, coverage of deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , which have equally high numbers of fatalities, seems to be best left unwritten," Mr Cannon said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He added that reports on road crashes may have a beneficial effect by alerting people to the fatal dangers of speed, drink and careless driving. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "However, it appears that coverage of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  fatalities is believed to have the opposite effect -- lest it should encourage emulation. I know there are still observable elements of social stigma surrounding the reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths and, quite possibly, this is primarily the single reason why \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is not given the same prominence." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He added that when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths were covered in the media, they were often vague and the reader was given "a hint", such as the use of the word "tragic", without any reason being offered. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "To me, it comes across that the lack of an explanation is in itself the explanation," Mr Cannon said. He added that in any case, details of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were often made public through new electronic communications. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said he recently attended a coroners' conference at which the media coverage of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was discussed. "It was felt the media ought to chart a sensible and realistic course, from the past traditions of evading or cover-up, to a new mode of acceptable reporting in a way that does justice to the social realities involved, without exploiting human grief in such sensitive cases." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, following Mr Cannon's comments, Jane Arigho from Headline -- the National Media Monitoring Programme for Mental Health and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  -- said she did not agree there was a "cover-up". 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "While Headline agrees that the media 'ought to chart a sensible and realistic course' when reporting on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , it does not support the suggestion by Mr Cannon that there is a 'cover-up' by the media in the reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She said the organisation had witnessed a steady increase in the reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in recent years, recording around 7,000 articles that referred to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2009.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "While there is evidence to suggest that certain types of reporting can contribute to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  contagion -- often referred to as copycat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  -- this is in relation to particularly irresponsible types of reporting, such as the provision of explicit details of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  method, inappropriate photography and sensational reporting," Ms Arigho said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "However, once care is taken when reporting on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the threat of contagion no longer exists. For example, reference can be given to an overdose but not to the specific type and number of tablets used. Similarly, saying someone hanged themselves is acceptable but the method or material used in hanging and ligatures should not be included," she added.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Excerpts from report by state-owned National Afghanistan TV on 30 October
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 [Announcer] Greetings. Recent events, including the terrorist attacks in both Kabul and Peshawar, the prolonged visit of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to Pakistan, and the Pakistani Army's offensive in Waziristan, indicate that a new chapter has been opened in the war against terrorism. Our programme discusses these issues. The programme guests are Kabul University lecturers Zia Rafat and Nasrollah Stanakzai and lawmaker Sayed Alemi Balkhi. [passage omitted on pleasantries]
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 [Announcer to Rafat] Are the terrorist attacks against the United Nations guesthouse in Kabul and a bazaar in Peshawar in reaction to the Waziristan operation? Is the military offensive in Waziristan serious or an operation in name only, just like previous such operations in the region? 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 [Rafat] The two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  operations pursued different objectives. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  operation in Kabul sought to intimidate the United Nations, which is organizing the election in Afghanistan. By attacking the UN guesthouse, the Taleban sought to send out a message to the UN that the Taleban are able to carry out \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  operations against the UN staff anywhere in Afghanistan. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  operation in Peshawar happened in the wake of Hillary Clinton's visit to Pakistan. The Peshawar attack was designed to send a message that the Taleban can carry out attacks anywhere in Pakistan and to embarrass the Pakistani military, which has been fighting the Taleban recently. The Peshawar attack, nevertheless, caused heavy civilian casualties, which is often the case in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attacks.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 [Announcer to Rafat] Nevertheless, there is a difference between the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attacks in Pakistan and the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attacks in Afghanistan. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attacks in Afghanistan have always targeted specific objectives, be they military or political objectives or the foreign forces or offices. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attacks in Afghanistan have never been without specific targets. However, in Pakistan, many times \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  operations have taken place in areas without specific targets. What is the reason for the distinction? Are there different forces that organize attacks in the two countries?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 [Rafat] In both Afghanistan and Pakistan, the security personnel, as well as the civilians, have been targeted by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  operations. It is very difficult to judge whether the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  operations are all organized by a centralized command structure or by different elements within what we term as Taleban and terrorist forces. In his recent Id message, Mullah Omar instructed his followers to avoid civilian casualties in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  operations. However, despite that message, civilians have fallen victim to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  operations. This indicates that either Mullah Omar's message was a public relations initiative aimed at influencing public opinion, or there are other hands that organize \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  operations. What is clear, though, is that what we know as the Taleban and terrorist forces are not a monolithic force; rather, there are many different constituent parts to these forces with different policies and even ideological differences between them.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 [Announcer to Balkhi] [passage omitted insisting that the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attacks in Afghanistan have specific military and official targets, while the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attack in Peshawar was against a common bazaar packed with women, children, and other civilians]
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Pakistan media also divides the Taleban between Afghan Taleban and Pakistani Taleban. The Pakistani media generally say that the Pakistani Taleban are fighting against the Pakistani military, but the Afghan Taleban do not want to fight against the Pakistani military. It is also believed that the Pakistani Taleban are close to Al-Qa'idah. Hence, when the Pakistani military moves against Al-Qa'idah, the Pakistani Taleban fight against the Pakistani military in defence of Al-Qa'idah. Does this mean that there are rifts between the Afghan Taleban and Al-Qa'idah?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 [Balkhi] [passage omitted]
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I think it is unrealistic to distinguish between the Afghan and Pakistani Taleban. The Taleban as a whole pursue a grand strategy in the regions. They want to establish their authority in parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan under the leadership of Al-Qa'idah. [passage omitted on lengthy discourse alleging that Al-Qa'idah was created jointly by the United States, Britain, some Arab countries, and Pakistan. He suggests that the United States knows about the whereabouts of the Al-Qa'idah leadership, but does not want to eliminate it. He suggests that Pakistani security forces may have carried out the terrorist attack in Peshawar that caused over 100 civilian casualties to demonstrate to Secretary Clinton that Pakistan is the victim of terrorism. He alleges that the transfer of Taleban to northern Afghanistan by coalition helicopters is a strategy of the coalition to draw Russia into the war against the Taleban]
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 [Announcer to Stanakzai] How serious is the Pakistani military's offensive against the Taleban in Waziristan?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 [Stanakzai] I believe that the Waziristan offensive is not serious. The Pakistani military launched the Waziristan offensive to attract US and western assistance. As such, I think the Pakistanis will prolong the conflict so as to gain as much US and western assistance as possible. [passage omitted on lengthy discourse alleging that the coalition is pushing the Afghan conflict into Central Asia and Iran as part of rivalries between the West, Russia, China, and Iran]
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 [Announcer to Rafat] Mention has been made here of the policies to push the conflict into Central Asia, China, and Iran. Hence, there are doubts about the genuineness of the war on terrorism, because the war seems to pursue other objectives in the region. There was also a reference here to efforts to draw Russia into the war in Afghanistan. Will Russia's involvement in the war in Afghanistan be in accordance with its own arrangements or the arrangements made for it by the coalition?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 [Rafat] [passage omitted on theory that an imminent threat of terrorism in Central Asia from the Afghan side will prompt the Central Asian governments to seek help from Russia. He maintains that the Russian help will not be sufficient to counter the threat of Al-Qa'idah, which will in turn prompt the Central Asian leaders to seek help from the United States. He argues that, since the United States enjoys superior military and economic resources compared to Russia, it will dominate the fight of the joint coalition of Central Asia, Russia and the West against terrorism. In this way, he maintains that the United States will extend its influence in Central Asia near the Chinese and Russian borders. He suggests that the United States is pushing the conflict into northern Afghanistan so as to extend its influence into Central Asia]

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 THE proposal to legalise assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , being presented by Margo MacDonald, the independent MSP, would have farreaching consequences on the manner in which \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , of any kind, would begin to be perceived in Scotland. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Until now, the attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of an individual, such as a young person, is never seen as something to be encouraged in society. Instead, a lot of concern is usually raised as to the individual's state of mind and the fact that he or she may need psychological assistance, support and counselling. In other words, it would be ethically very wrong to help someone commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in these circumstances.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Scotland, around two people kill themselves every day and the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is generally higher than in other parts of the UK. Because of this, the Scottish Government launched the Choose Life programme in 2002, which is a 10-year strategy and action plan to try to prevent and reduce the high rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  On the Choose Life website it is indicated that, in Scotland, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is one of the main causes of death among young people. It also emphasises that every life lost to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a tragedy - whatever the person's age - representing a lost life, a lost mother or father, brother, sister, son or daughter, and a wound that does not easily heal in those who are left behind.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Moreover, most people who attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  do not want to die; they want to end the pain they are suffering. In the light of this, if assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was ever decriminalised in Scotland, even though physical suffering can be adequately addressed through palliative care, a very real danger would exist that the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of individuals, such as healthy young persons, would also begin to be considered as acceptable to society. And this would happen at the very time the government is trying to reduce the very high \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in Scotland.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Indeed, there is a very real risk that the legalisation of assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  would completely undermine any attempt in Scotland to reduce the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  which may become an acceptable exit in the face of depression or hardships.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Moreover, we should remember that as soon as a second person is consciously involved in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of a person, and that this is accepted by society, it is then society as a whole that gives its consent to this \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .  This would give rise to very dangerous consequences concerning the manner in which the whole of society would consider  the value, meaning and worth of a human life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Encouraging any person to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is highly irresponsible and unacceptable. Because of this, assisting any person to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  would put extremely vulnerable persons at risk and should not be possible in Scotland.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 MONTREAL -- Neuroscientists have found a surprising link between depression, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and epilepsy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The same brain dysfunction underlying epilepsy may also determine whether people are at risk for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , lead researcher Dale Hesdorffer of Columbia University in New York explained Tuesday in a study published online in the journal Annals of Neurology. "For reasons that are not understood, depression both increases the risk for developing epilepsy and is also common among people with epilepsy who experience many seizures," Hesdorffer said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hesdorffer's team looked at data from 324 people in Iceland with epilepsy and 647 without the disorder.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's a common assumption that difficulties living with epilepsy could provoke depression, and in some cases, an increased risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . But researchers were surprised to find people with epilepsy are four times more likely to have attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  before ever having a seizure, even after other factors were taken into account like drinking alcohol, having depression, age and gender.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The study confirmed what scientists have known for a while -- that people with major depression are nearly twice as likely to develop epilepsy as those without depression.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "But what has never been shown before is that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt is associated with an increased risk for developing epilepsy," Hesdorffer said. "This may, in part, clarify the increased risk for completed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  observed in people with epilepsy."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That's because attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a known risk for further attempts, "some of which will unfortunately result in completed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," she added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While the study results suggest a common brain dysfunction might be responsible for epilepsy and suicidal behaviour, findings also point to different mechanisms behind depression and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The current study did not address those mechanisms. That's the next step, Hesdorffer said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 McGill University professor Gustavo Tureki, director of the McGill group for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  studies at the Douglas Hospital, which is researching the biological factors of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , called the study an important step forward.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Depression and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  often go together," Tureki said. But the Iceland study suggests that the association between epilepsy and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is not through major depression, Tureki said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The higher prevalence of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among epileptics was independent of the fact that they were also more likely to be depressed," Tureki said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Study results suggest clinicians need to ask epileptic patients about previous \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts, experts said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Professionals involved in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention should be aware of this information," said Louis Lemay, director of the Quebec Association for the Prevention of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  UNDER Victorian laws the act of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are no longer crimes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But it is a crime to aid or abet someone to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or incite them to do so. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Aiding and abetting involves helping in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The act of incitement includes requesting, proposing, advising, encouraging or authorising someone to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But it is not enough to prove that someone actively encouraged or advised someone else to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to prove the offence.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Legal observers told the Herald Sun  yesterday the prosecution needed to show the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was a direct result of the incitement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A jury must be convinced beyond reasonable doubt that what the accused said or did caused the victim to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If it can be shown that the victim intended committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  all along, or there were other influences on him or her, that link can be broken.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One leading barrister said crimes of that nature often involved few if any independent witnesses or hard evidence.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "That makes a prosecution difficult," he said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Men are much more successful at committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than women while women are more likely to attempt it according to new Health Ministry statistics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  According to ministry estimates about 350 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year from 1998 to 2000. Of these 22 percent were aged 15 to 24 and 85% of them males. While the ministry received reports of 1 540 people attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  during each of these years the actual figure could be between 3 500 and 4 0 because some attempts are covered up or unreported. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Because of the lack of data it's impossible to fully assess this phenomenon said Stein. While \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates among young Israeli Jews is declining somewhat, it is still higher than it was during the early '90s. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates are increasing among young Israeli Arabs and nearing the rates of their Jewish counterparts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Females constitute 70% of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts in the 15- 24-year-old age group, but this rate drops as women get older. People 15 to 24 constitute 35% of those who attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Since only 18% of the population is 15 to 24, the rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt are disproportionate, and this age group can be considered high-risk.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The ministry noted that Israel ranks only 26th among 30 Western countries in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates, and that the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 residents even seems to be declining somewhat. But there is under-reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and especially of attempts, said statistician Nehama Stein, because autopsies are rare and because people who try to kill themselves often hide it, explaining away the injury as the result of an accident, or avoid going to a hospital emergency room.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Moreover, reporting practices by emergency room staffers are not uniform. The hospitals don't all take care to fill out forms properly so important information needed to identify high-risk groups is absent Stein said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Thus the ministry estimates that the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts is twice the figure actually reported, and the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a third higher than reported figures. The ministry receives data on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempts from emergency rooms, the Central Bureau of Statistics, and the L. Greenberg Institute for Forensic Medicine at Abu Kabir.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Chief psychologist Dalia Gilboa said the ministry is trying to encourage hospitals to accurately report \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempted-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases, and to pay particular attention to high-risk groups. Special effort will be made to identify young people considering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The ministry's statistical report will be published (for the first time but in Hebrew only) on its Web site (www.health.gov.il http: / www.health.gov.il) within a few days.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SHARP RISE REPORTED IN YOUTH \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 SUICIDES\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The rate at which teenagers and adolescents kill themselves has soared since 1980, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The increases were sharpest for young black males; the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate quadrupled among those aged 10 to 14. In the early-twenties age category, in which there was an overall slight decline, black males were the only group to go against the trend of declining \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates. The increase in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate was also very steep for white females aged 10 to 14. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Between 1980 and 1992, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates rose 28 percent among Americans 15 to 19, and 120 percent among those aged 10 to 14, the CDC said. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate fell 7 percent among Americans aged 20 to 24.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Although \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among children is a rare event," the report concluded, "the dramatic increase in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate among persons aged 10 to 14 years underscores the urgent need for intensifying efforts to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " in that age group.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Noting that the causes of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are "multiple and complex," the CDC said possible factors in the increased rate among young people include substance abuse, mental illness, family disruption, severe stress in school or social life, rapid social change and "increased access to firearms by the at-risk population."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among people under 25, nearly two-thirds (65 percent) were committed with guns. Hanging was the second most common method, and poisoning ranked third. Firearm-related \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  accounted for most of the increase in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate for teenagers between 1980 and 1992, the CDC reported.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After reviewing programs throughout the nation, the CDC said it has identified strategies for preventing youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . These include training teachers and school officials to identify young people at highest risk for suicidal thoughts and attempts, educating young persons about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and setting up referral programs and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  crisis hot lines.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 BMJ People with acne are more likely to attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  during and after a course of isotretinoin, a study finds, but researchers say the drug is rarely to blame.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a retrospective study of isotretinoin-treated patients who had attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , researchers found the risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  began to climb before treatment began. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Writing in the BMJ (online), they said this suggested \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  risk was related to acne itself rather than treatment with isotretinoin (Roaccutane, Oratane).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Furthermore, patients who made \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts before treatment "did not seem to have this behaviour reinforced by treatment with isotretinoin", the large Swedish study found.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 By contrast, patients who made their first \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt after commencing treatment were twice as likely to make further attempts as those who made their first attempt before commencing treatment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This led the authors to conclude that people with severe acne but a history of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  should not be denied isotretinoin treatment.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Of 5756 patients treated with isotretinoin between 1980-89, 128 attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  within the next 20 years and 24 died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the study found.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Comparing this with the expected background \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate, the authors said 2300 new prescriptions of isotretinoin would need to be written to provoke one additional \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt, and more than double that for a repeated \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The increased risk was apparent up to six months after the end of treatment, the study found.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, three years after treatment had stopped, the rate of attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among patients was lower than before treatment, and similar to the background population rate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The authors therefore suggested that for some patients, treatment with isotretinoin "may attenuate \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  behaviour".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "For certain vulnerable patients however, isotretinoin may trigger such [suicidal] behaviour," they said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Until further data became available, they recommended close monitoring of the mental status of acne patients, regardless of whether they were taking isotretinoin.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A spokeswoman for Roaccutane manufacturer, Roche, said the company would continue to monitor the drug's safety, adding it had been prescribed worldwide to more than 16 million patients.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dear Annie: Today, people throughout the world will be observing World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, an annual event co-sponsored by the International Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention (IASP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is one of the leading causes of death in the world. Approximately one million people worldwide die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year. This corresponds to one every 40 seconds. The number of lives lost each year through \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  exceeds the number of deaths due to homicide and war combined. These figures do not include \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts, which may be up to 20 times the number of deaths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The economic costs associated with self-inflicted death or injuries are estimated to be in the billions of dollars a year. The psychological and social impact of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on the family and community is staggering. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is good news, though. Organizations across the globe such as ours are making advances in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention research, understanding and outreach. Despite the complexity of this phenomenon, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be prevented. There are many crisis centers throughout the world that offer support by phone, email, forums and chat.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention organizations, locally and across the world, are joining IASP in encouraging people to "light a candle near a window at 8:00 p.m." on World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day - Monday, Sept. 10 - to show support for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, to remember a lost loved one and for the survivors of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Please ask your readers for their kind support in lighting a candle and, if they are in distress, to call a helpline or crisis center. This information can be found on our website at www.iasp.info. Thank you. - Lanny Berman, Ph.D., ABPP, President, International Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dear Dr. Berman: We appreciate the opportunity to tell our readers about World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day. We hope they will light a candle near a window (although please not near flammable drapes or blinds) and remember those who have died. We also hope those in need will check your website.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Obliged to attend?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dear Annie: I have been invited to the wedding of my co-worker's daughter, whom I have never met. My co-worker has made it quite clear that he is expecting us to attend. At his first daughter's wedding, he invited 20 co-workers and only one showed up. He was very upset.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Am I obligated to attend his daughter's wedding? - RSVP
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dear RSVP: You are not obligated to attend, although you might want to weigh that choice against Monday's reaction at the office. While we don't care for co-workers who pressure others to attend their personal events, consider whether he wants your presence or your presents. If you would feel more comfortable, send a small gift with your regrets.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Stuck in the middle
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dear Annie: I was in a similar situation as "In the Middle." My grandmother also made me feel second best, and I often received gifts that were not age appropriate. Your suggestion that Mom stay out of it and let the now-adult granddaughter thank Grandma for any gifts and share what she chooses is sound advice. That is what my mother and I have been doing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I would like to mention another possibility. Perhaps the grandmother's upbringing and culture could be playing a part in her behavior toward the granddaughter, since it did in my case. In some cultures, the older generation is still having a difficult time making the transition from their traditional ideas. In realizing this, I have become more understanding about my grandmother's behavior and react with more compassion. She's trying her best. - Been There, Too

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A national survey on suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adults made in 2008 and 2009 found wide variations by region, with, generally, more Westerners and Midwesterners contemplating \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than did Southerners or people in the Northeast. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report, released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is the first to look at suicidal thoughts, plans and attempts - rather than completed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - on a state-by-state basis.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 About 4.6 percent of adult Coloradans gave serious thought to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the previous year, compared with the national average of 3.7 percent. Utah had the highest rate of thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - 6.8 percent. Rhode Island was at the top for planning a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  even while reporting one of the lowest successful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in the nation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Overall, about 1 percent of American adults went so far as to make \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  plans, compared with 1.4 percent of Coloradans.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 About one-half percent - or about 1 million Americans - attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The research, gathered through the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, can be used by states to identify and improve their most effective \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -prevention strategies, the CDC report stated.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There are several theories as to why there are differences between the areas where a lot of people contemplate \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the areas where successful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is most common.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Demographics could be part of the answer. Women and young adults are more likely to think about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  while older men are more likely to succeed. The availability of guns or access to emergency health care could also affect the rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the U.S., 36,035 people died in 2008 as a result of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the report said. About 666,000 visited hospital emergency departments for nonfatal, self-inflicted injuries.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Depression carries a high risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Anybody who expresses suicidal thoughts or intentions should be taken very seriously. Do not hesitate to call your local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  hotline immediately. Call 1-800-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 SUICIDE\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  (800-784-2433) or 1-800-273-TALK (800-273-8255)
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If you or someone you love has clinical depression, it's important to recognize the warning signs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention is highly possible. And there are signs to look for that say someone may be contemplating a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The best way to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with clinical depression is to know the risk factors for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and to recognize the warning signs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Take these signs seriously. Know how to respond to them. It could save someone's life.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a potentially preventable public health problem. It accounts for more than 1 percent of all deaths in the U.S. each year. In 2001, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was the 11th leading cause of death in the U.S.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Among young people age 15 to 24, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the third most common cause of death. Four times as many men die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as women. And 73 percent of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths are white males.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Risk factors for thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can vary with age, gender, and ethnic group. And risk factors often occur in combinations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 More than 90 percent of people who die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have clinical depression or another diagnosable mental disorder. Many times, people who die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have a substance abuse problem. Often they have that problem in combination with other mental disorders.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Adverse or traumatic life events in combination with other risk factors, such as clinical depression, may lead to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . But \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and suicidal behavior are never normal responses to stress.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Other risk factors for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  include:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   One or more prior \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Family history of mental disorder or substance abuse
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Family history of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Family violence
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Physical or sexual abuse
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Keeping firearms in the home
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Incarceration
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Exposure to the suicidal behavior of others
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Warning signs that someone may be thinking about or planning to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  include:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Always talking or thinking about death
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Clinical depression deep sadness, loss of interest, trouble sleeping and eating - that gets worse
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Having a "death wish," tempting fate by taking risks that could lead to death such as driving fast or running red lights
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Losing interest in things one used to care about
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Making comments about being hopeless, helpless, or worthless
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Putting affairs in order, tying up loose ends, changing a will
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Saying things like "It would be better if I wasn't here," or "I want out."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Sudden, unexpected switch from being very sad to being very calm or appearing to be happy
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Talking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or killing one's self
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Visiting or calling people to say good-bye
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Be especially concerned if a person is exhibiting any of these warning signs and has attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the past. According to the American Foundation for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention, between 20 percent and 50 percent of people who commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have had a previous attempt.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What should you do if someone has signs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and clinical depression?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 First, if someone you know appears to be depressed and is contemplating \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , take that person seriously. Listen to what he or she is saying. Take the initiative to ask that person what he or she is planning. But don't attempt to argue him or her out of committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Rather, let the person know that you care and understand and are listening. Avoid statements like: "You have so much to live for."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If someone you know appears to be depressed and talks about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , makes a suicidal gesture, or attempts \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , take it as a serious emergency. Listen to the person, but don't try to argue with him or her. Seek immediate help from a health care professional.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Depressed people are often suicidal. It is a key symptom of the disease. Some studies show that the neurotransmitter serotonin plays a central role in the neurobiology of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Researchers have found lower levels of serotonin in the brainstem and cerebrospinal fluid of suicidal individuals.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In addition, suicidal behavior sometimes runs in families. Remember, any talk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is always an emergency. Have the person talk with a health care professional immediately.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Encourage the person to seek the help of a mental health professional. Because the person probably doesn't think it's possible to be helped, you'll probably have to be persistent and go with that person.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If your loved one appears to be in imminent danger of committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , do not leave him or her alone. Remove any weapons or drugs he or she could use. Accompany him or her to the nearest emergency room.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 During treatment, be supportive. Help the person remember to take antidepressant medications and to continue any other therapy that's been prescribed.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0    Myths about teenage \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  get in the way of effective prevention programs, according to University of Utah researchers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , by its nature, is a complex problem," they wrote. "Many myths have developed about individuals who complete \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  risk factors, current prevention programs and the treatment of at-risk youth."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Misconceptions are found among parents, health professionals, school administrators, government officials and the media. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Researchers Michelle Moskos, Intermountain Injury Control Research Center; Jennifer Achilles, U. School of Medicine; and Doug Gray, U. Department of Psychiatry, conducted the study to separate fact from fiction and to offer recommendations for future prevention programs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Their conclusions include the following:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Myth: \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is caused by family and social stress such as loss, rejection or discipline.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: Those events are common in a teenager's life, and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a rare outcome.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 People often attribute \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to breaking up with a boyfriend or girlfriend, arguments with parents or disciplinary action.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Teenagers who kill themselves do have more stress and family dysfunction, but at least 90 percent have a mental illness. Furthermore, mental illness runs in families.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "is caused" by an interplay of biological, psychological, environmental and social factors, according to the study.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Myth: \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempters and completers are the same.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: Males are four times as likely to die from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but females are more likely to attempt it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Current \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention efforts do not focus on high-risk groups, the study shows. School programs that consist of a brief, one-time lecture are not effective. Females use crisis hotlines more than males, thus having little effect on those most at risk.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reduced access to guns may be one of the "most promising underused strategies" in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Unfortunately, a recent study demonstrated that only 25 percent of gun owners remove firearms from their home when repeatedly asked to do so by their teenager's mental health provider."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Myth: Current prevention programs work.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: School education programs, teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  hotlines and efforts to limit firearms access have not significantly lowered teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The majority of teens who kill themselves have never made a prior attempt, the researchers wrote. And boys are more likely than girls to die from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  because they use lethal means such as guns. That and cultural influences that make it more acceptable for males to take their lives account for their higher \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Myth: \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is not inherited.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: Genetics has a critical role in mental illness and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Some families have increased risk for depression over generations, while others have increased risk for depression and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Future prevention programs need to focus on predispositions to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the researchers say.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Myth: Teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  represents treatment failure.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: Studies indicate few \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  completers were in treatment at the time of their deaths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Government data showed that 1 percent of teenagers who took their lives were in public mental health treatment and 3 percent had psychotropic drugs in their systems.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The leveling off of youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  coincides with increased use of antidepressants and mood stabilizers. There is no proof of a causal link, but other known risk factor such as divorce or substance abuse were unchanged.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Parents identified the stigma of mental illness and the denial of mental illness as the most significant barrier between teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  completers and treatment."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Myth: Teenagers have the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: Elderly white males have always had the highest rate, but adolescent rates more than tripled between the 1960s and 1990s.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is one of the leading causes of death for teenagers. In addition, cluster \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occur predominantly with teens. The researchers found that a lack of appropriate treatment or compliance with treatment for mental illness leads to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rather than the illness alone.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Moskos, Achilles and Gray say the six myths they identified show better research is needed to combat the high teenage \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate, and that too often \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention programs aren't designed, implemented and evaluated with appropriate supporting research.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Psychiatric illnesses are often viewed differently from other medical problems. Public awareness, researchers said, could close the gap between the perception of mental and physical illness as separate issues. E-mail: lucy@desnews.com; romboy@desnews.com

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a global issue and a leading cause of death in the world claiming lives of around one million people every year. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a multidimensional disorder, which results from a complex interaction of biological, genetic, psychological and environmental factors, said eminent psychiatric of Sir Cowasji Jehangir (S.C.J.) Institute of Psychiatry, Hyderabad Dr. Darya Khan Laghari, Thursday. In a country like Pakistan where growing economic instability especially poverty has forced people to sell their children and body organs, he said the reasons behind increasing rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is understandable.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr. Darya Khan Laghari, said that some psychology experts also agree with the fact that majority of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are usually linked to economic difficulties but there are other reasons behind committing of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and these reasons can be depressive disorders, unemployment, domestic violence, parental separation, growing economic instability, child abuse, bullying, rising inflation and loss of social cohesion which force a person to end his or her life or release them from the pain they are suffering from. Besides economic instability the factors of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Pakistan by certain analysis and surveys conducted by people are psychiatric disorders, marital status (being married), unemployment and negative and stressful life events, he said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr. Laghari, said that Pakistan has witnessed a series of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombings in recent years. In \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombing a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bomber blows himself, also causing an immense and fatal destruction in the areas around it, he said. He added that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombing is also one of the reasons that enable a person to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and end his life through such a sinful way. He said that these are some instances, which appear through media as many cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Pakistan are not reported. In recent years, psychiatrist said that Pakistan has witnessed a drastic increase in the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but the basic thing is that it does not collect national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  statistics nor report them to WHO (World Health Organization) so due to that it has become very difficult to compile global \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  statistics and thus made the planning of prevention programmes, almost impossible.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said that the facts showed that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has not only become a major health problem in Pakistan, but that there are no official statistics and national rates are unknown. The other reason to support this aspect is also that when a person attempts \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  his or her family usually tries to cover this act and claims this incident as merely an incident thus it is becoming difficult for Pakistan to compile national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  statistics and report them to the WHO, he said. He said that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has become quite a delicate and multifaceted problem in Pakistan but rates of men are consistently higher than women and men outnumber women by 2:1 and there are more single then married men.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said that the surveys and analysis showed that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has become more common in youth than in adult in many countries and Pakistan is one of them. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates among youth are increasing due to unemployment, pressure of work and studies, depression, anxiety and increasing poverty, he said. Dr. Darya Khan Laghari further elaborated that Pakistan's population is 162 million and it is ranked as the 6th most populous country in the world. The official unemployment stands at 12 percent of the eligible workforce and health spending is only 0.7 percent of the national annual budget, he said and added that Pakistan is also a Muslim country and according to Islam \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is considered forbidden and prohibited. Islam is the only religion that has a clear scriptural ban on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , so, it has an independent effect on lowering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates but still many people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  everyday in Pakistan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to World Health Organisation (WHO) statistics, he said that more than a million people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year worldwide, while the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt is successful 1020 times. He said that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and depression are linked to each other as more than 80 percent of people who commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  suffer from depression. He said studies suggest that lifetime risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in people with depression was 15 percent, with alcoholism 715 percent and with schizophrenia, 410 percent. However, a substantial proportion of people who commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  die without having seen a mental health professional, he said and added that detection, and referral and management of psychiatric disorders in primary care was an important step in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Department of Public health and environmental, The State of Colorado has issued the following news release:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Colorado continues to have one of the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in the nation, but a new state commission has begun to tackle the problem.
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      The state Legislature created the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Commission to identify statewide priorities and partnerships in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention. Commissioners from across Colorado met for the first time Oct. 17. They began developing strategies and identified their first priority: working with Colorado Crisis Support Services to make sure patients admitted to emergency rooms because of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts receive care and support after discharge. 
\par \pard 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0      "We are at a tipping point of change around \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention in Colorado," said Sally Spencer-Thomas, CEO & co-founder of the Carson J Spencer Foundation, and a commissioner. "New and needed voices are stepping in to elevate the conversation and make \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention a health and safety priority."
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      In 2013, 1,004 Coloradans died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . That's down from the state's peak of 1,053 in 2012, but still represents the second-highest number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Colorado history. State \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates have been climbing for more than a decade, and Colorado ranks sixth in the nation for deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      "For too long, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has devastated Colorado families," said Jarrod Hindman, director of the Office of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention at the state health department and co-chair of the commission. "We need to put our best minds to work making sure Coloradans battling depression or contemplating \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have the resources they need to stay alive."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Leader (May 27) had an item on the important issue of youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  What is of real concern to me, is, that I never hear calls for survivors of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to join those wanting to educate and dissuade people from committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I am a cancer survivor and that is highly respected in the community. Yet, I am also a "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  survivor", and writing as such, I am not game to put my name to this letter.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Over and over I have confronted the severe torment of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  I have been hospitalised repeatedly in order to keep me safe in this world, when I want to be gone, so that the suffering in my mind can stop - I hope, and I plead with God not to be condemned.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I respectfully suggest that if we want the community, especially our young people, to learn more about what leads to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide;\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  what it may be like to be suicidal; and considerations of ways to deter \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide;\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  people working in this area need to look to those who have endured skirmishes with desperate yearnings to be dead. I recommend that "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  presentations" include either in person, or in writing, or at least in preparation, an account from a "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  survivor", whom you believe has insight into their life and death battles.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To begin with, people need to stop referring to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as doing "something silly" or "being selfish".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 do not use these terms for those who die from other severe illnesses. It may be necessary to confront the "copycat" element of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide, if suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is spoken about openly, and this would need to be done in a careful way.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Remember, if you want to find out about what it is like to give birth to a baby, you would not rely on a male obstetrician for your information; you would ask a mother. If you want to work in the field of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, learn from those who are serious "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  survivors".

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 New Delhi, May 2 -- \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths have surpassed deaths from motor vehicle crashes in recent years in the United States. In 2010 there were 33,687 deaths from motor vehicle crashes and 38,364 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates among middle-aged Americans have risen substantially since 1999, according to a report in today's CDC journal, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a tragedy that is far too common," said CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H. "The stories we hear of those who are impacted by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are very difficult. This report highlights the need to expand our knowledge of risk factors so we can build on prevention programs that prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ."
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 CDC investigated \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  trends among U.S. adults aged 35 to 64 by sex and other demographic characteristics, state of residence, and mechanism of injury from 1999 to 2010, using data available through CDC's Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS). Annual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates for this age group increased 28 percent over this period (from 13.7 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 people in 1999 to 17.6 per 100,000 in 2010), with particularly high increases among non-Hispanic whites and American Indians and /Alaska Natives. Increases in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates among males and females were also observed from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  involving hanging/suffocation, poisoning, and firearms. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates for those aged 10 to 34 and those aged 65 years and older did not change significantly during this period, the report said.
\par \pard 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates among those aged 35 to 64 increased in all states with statistically significant increases occurring in 39 states.
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 "The findings in this report suggest it is important for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategies to address the types of stressors that middle-aged Americans might be facing and that can contribute to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  risk," said Linda C. Degutis, Dr.P.H., M.S.N., director of CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control.
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Key findings:
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 * \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates among those 35 to 64 years old increased 28 percent (32 percent for women, 27 percent for men).
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 * The greatest increases in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates were among people aged 50 to 54 years (48 percent) and 55 to 59 years (49 percent).
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 * Among racial/ethnic groups, the greatest increases in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates were among white non-Hispanics (40 percent) and American Indian and Alaska Natives (65 percent).
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 * \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates increased 23 percent or more across all four major regions of the United States.
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 * \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates increased 81 percent for hanging/suffocation, compared to 14 percent for firearm and 24 percent for poisoning.
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 * Firearm and hanging/suffocation were the most common \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  mechanisms for middle-aged men. Poisoning and firearm were the most common mechanisms for middle-aged women.
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  research and prevention efforts have focused historically on youth and the elderly. This report's findings suggest that efforts should also address the needs of middle-aged persons.
\par \pard 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategies involve enhancing social support and community connectedness, improving access to mental health and preventive services, and reducing the stigma and barriers associated with seeking help. Other prevention strategies include programs to help those at increased risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , such as those struggling with financial challenges, job loss, intimate partner problems or violence, stress of caregiving for children and aging parents, substance abuse, and serious or chronic health problems.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 DATELINE: \b0 \i0 \ul0 Nepal 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nepal, Nov. 25 -- Not just infectious diseases cause epidemics. Even catchy ideas and behaviors do, sometimes to devastating effects. In his bestselling book The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell discusses the harrowing trend of teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the South Pacific islands of Micronesia. In the 1970's and 1980's, the teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate of Micronesia was ten times higher than the world average. "Teenagers were literally being infected with the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bug," writes Gladwell in his official blog, "and one after another they were killing themselves in exactly the same way under exactly the same circumstances." The spread of teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Micronesia was a case of transmission of a destructive behavior on a mass scale. This is the reason that recent government data on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in Nepal is so alarming. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There were 348 reported cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Nepal in 2011; 44 percent of the victims were from 15-29 age group and 29 percent from 30-44 age group. Hanging and poisoning were reported as the most common methods of ending one's life. If past studies of socio-cultural trends like the one on teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Micronesia are any guide, as Nepalis witness a growing number of their brethren cut their own lives short, still more Nepalis, particularly those belonging to the vulnerable age groups, are likely to see themselves capable of taking the drastic step. If the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases keeps increasing, there could come a point at which even otherwise normal people might consider \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a viable option to deal with life's hardships.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the Department of Health Services' Family Health Division, 78 percent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases in Nepal are caused by psychological or mental trauma. In Nepal's case, psychological traumas are mostly related to poverty, health concerns, gender-based violence and financial problems. The danger is that continued prevalence of these risk factors in conjunction with uninformed (even glamorized) reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , could accelerate the march to the tipping point.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As it is, the situation is already troubling. Between July 2010 and June 2011, 262 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases were registered in Kathmandu alone. These figures do not include \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts: for every fatal \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt, there are 20 unsuccessful ones. Parsing of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases in Nepal reveals that women and adolescents are at an elevated risk of committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , not surprising in a still highly patriarchal society with fast changing family values and social ties.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates are increasing, it remains underreported, which might not be a bad thing. Results from past social science experiments-controlling for other factors, the higher the number of uninformed reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases, the greater the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -suggest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  need to be reported with caution. Strained family and social ties in a rapidly urbanizing Nepal coupled with its prolonged political instability and growing joblessness are making Nepalis increasingly vulnerable to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The danger is that once the level of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  hits a certain level (the tipping point), it might spiral out of control. It is thus important to try to nip the problem in the bud. The message going out to those suffering from elevated stress levels has to be that there are ways to successfully cope with life's hardships and if needed, help is available Published by HT Syndication with permission from Republica.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ASSISTED \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and euthanasia are both illegal in Ireland and the UK and carry severe custodial sentences.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Euthanasia - from the Greek for 'good death' - is any action of a third party to deliberately end an individual's life. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Providing any guidance, information or medication is viewed as aiding in euthanasia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is when an individual takes their own life with the help of another.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Both euthanasia and assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are illegal in Ireland under the Criminal Law (\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ) Act 1993 and in the UK under the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Act 1961.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Assisting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  carries a sentence of up to 14 years in both countries.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The only four places that openly and legally authorise forms of assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are the US state of Oregon, Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Some countries allow only for physician-assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , while others are more liberal and allow for patient \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  also.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dignitas is a Swiss organisation which facilitates assisted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and has been used by Irish people in the past.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, terminally ill people who travel to Dignitas from Ireland and the UK have to be well enough to perform the final act themselves.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dear Annie: Today, people throughout the world will be observing World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, an annual event co-sponsored by the International Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention (IASP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is one of the leading causes of death in the world. Approximately one million people worldwide die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year. This corresponds to one every 40 seconds. The number of lives lost each year through \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  exceeds the number of deaths due to homicide and war combined. These figures do not include \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts, which may be up to 20 times the number of deaths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The economic costs associated with self-inflicted death or injuries are estimated to be in the billions of dollars a year. The psychological and social impact of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  on the family and community is staggering. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is good news, though. Organizations across the globe such as ours are making advances in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention research, understanding and outreach. Despite the complexity of this phenomenon, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be prevented. There are many crisis centers throughout the world that offer support by phone, email, forums and chat.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention organizations, locally and across the world, are joining IASP in encouraging people to "light a candle near a window at 8:00 p.m." on World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day - Monday, Sept. 10 - to show support for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, to remember a lost loved one and for the survivors of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Please ask your readers for their kind support in lighting a candle and, if they are in distress, to call a helpline or crisis center. This information can be found on our website at www.iasp.info. Thank you. - Lanny Berman, Ph.D., ABPP, President, International Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dear Dr. Berman: We appreciate the opportunity to tell our readers about World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day. We hope they will light a candle near a window (although please not near flammable drapes or blinds) and remember those who have died. We also hope those in need will check your website.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Obliged to attend?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dear Annie: I have been invited to the wedding of my co-worker's daughter, whom I have never met. My co-worker has made it quite clear that he is expecting us to attend. At his first daughter's wedding, he invited 20 co-workers and only one showed up. He was very upset.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Am I obligated to attend his daughter's wedding? - RSVP
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dear RSVP: You are not obligated to attend, although you might want to weigh that choice against Monday's reaction at the office. While we don't care for co-workers who pressure others to attend their personal events, consider whether he wants your presence or your presents. If you would feel more comfortable, send a small gift with your regrets.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Stuck in the middle
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dear Annie: I was in a similar situation as "In the Middle." My grandmother also made me feel second best, and I often received gifts that were not age appropriate. Your suggestion that Mom stay out of it and let the now-adult granddaughter thank Grandma for any gifts and share what she chooses is sound advice. That is what my mother and I have been doing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I would like to mention another possibility. Perhaps the grandmother's upbringing and culture could be playing a part in her behavior toward the granddaughter, since it did in my case. In some cultures, the older generation is still having a difficult time making the transition from their traditional ideas. In realizing this, I have become more understanding about my grandmother's behavior and react with more compassion. She's trying her best. - Been There, Too

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As Korea continues its battle against rising \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates, organizations and civic groups planned a wide range of activities and events for Monday to mark World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day here. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates have decreased in many developed nations since 1995, the rate has increased rapidly in Korea.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 2010 alone, more than 15,500 people in Korea committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . This amounts to about 28.4 deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for every 100,000 people, or 42 deaths every day \'e2[#x20ac]o the highest rate among the OECD countries, followed by an average of 19.8 people in Hungary and 19.7 in Japan, according to recent OECD data.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Participants walk in front of a panel written on with words of consolation during an event held at the Gyeonggi Provincial Government office to promote \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention on Friday. (Yonhap News)
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Campaigners note that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is often linked with depression, and early detection by families and health professionals is key to preventing people from taking their own lives.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's time to recognize that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is not a personal matter, but a social problem," said an official from the Korean Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention, calling on the government to introduce measures to tackle the rising \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Park Jong-ik, head of the Korea \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Center, said that the Korean government's annual spending of 2 billion won ($1.7 million) on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention is relatively low, compared to that of Japan's roughly $250 million.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Park told Yonhap News agency that "the government should prioritize it among other polices, and not only inject the money but introduce all necessary measures to reduce the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, which falls on Sept. 10 every year, is co-organized by the World Health Organization and the International Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention to promote worldwide commitment and action to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 JAMMU, March 21 -- The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate seems to be consistently on the rise in Jammu region. Despite the efforts of various organizations to check this trend, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the state, even within 3 months records total number of people 22, who attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and 212 people consumed posing substance. Surprisingly, most of these cases involve youngsters in the age group of 17 to 28 years. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The data of Government Medical College, report of deaths and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  across state.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Jammu province reported road accidents 5 to 10 case people a day, It is shocking that the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  between January to 21March, have registered 234 cases of poison and alcohol and 29 people due to this 22 people attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and 10 died.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Youth in the age group of 17-28 are found most likely to take their own lives, though teenagers as young as 13 years old have also committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  over the last two decades. The recorded 248 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2010, in 2011, over 1000 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases were registered. Most of people say in urban areas, hanging, jumping into rivers and consuming poison are some of the most common methods. In villages pesticides are often used. Women commonly set themselves ablaze during \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Amongst teenagers, poor impulse control, examination stress, love affairs and parental pressures are found to be prominent reasons for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Meanwhile unemployment and financial stress has become a major cause of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among the youth in Jammu and Kashmir, with Jammu region leading the state in number people committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Concerned with the increasing number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases in the state, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India will be providing assistance of Rs 8.50 crore to the state government for up gradation of academic, clinical and diagnostic facilities at the Psychiatric Hospitals in Srinagar and Jammu.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "From the medical point of view, the reason to increased mental health problems which include depression, post-traumatic stress disorders, anxiety related disorders arisen due to the stress among the youth", says the government data.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Though the data released by the state government says that the overall tendency of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among the youth has not increased in past two years (2008 and 2009. But the year 2008, 122 youth committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  while as in 2009, 118 youth committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  across the state.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "In other districts of Jammu region number of people committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is more than the Kashmir valley, which is matter of concern for the government", says the government document.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The reasons behind \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are mainly unemployment, financial stress, high expectations of parents from their children in examination, incompatibility in relations between married couples and other social factors", says the data.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to Minister for Health Sham Lal Sharma, "Many NGOs including "Doctors without Borders" are offering free consultations and counseling, various seminars and symposia are being conducted by Government and semi-government agencies to educate the people".

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   An association between improvements in mental health services and reduction in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates has been established in a recent study.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Using nine national recommendations for safer services made by the National Confidential Inquiry, researchers compared the rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in NHS Mental Health Trusts before and after the recommendations were adopted.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They compared \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in Trusts that adopted few of the recommendations with those that adopted many. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The study showed that Trusts that implemented between seven and nine of the key recommendations had lower \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates than those that implemented six or fewer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Recommendations that produced the biggest drop in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates, when implemented, were the introduction of 24-hour crisis teams, policies for drug and alcohol misuse, and multi-disciplinary reviews after a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The study also shows that the growing use of the recommendations is linked to a reduction in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in specific patient groups. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A reduction in in-patient \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was associated with the removal of ligature points in hospitals.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A reduction in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among patients with a history of missed contact with services was associated with assertive outreach services, designed to keep in touch with them after they left hospital. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Trusts that did not implement the recommendations saw little reduction in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The National Confidential Inquiry has been collecting and studying data on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by people in contact with mental health services in the UK since 1997. This study focused on the 12,881 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 91 mental health services in England and Wales between 1997 and 2006. This represents 26% of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in England and Wales during this time. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nav Kapur, Professor of Psychiatry and Population Health said: "These are really important findings for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  research and mental health services internationally. No other studies have been able to show what impact specific mental health service improvements have on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "For most of the nine recommendations, services that implemented them had a decreased \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate after implementation. The results show that NHS services and mental health professionals are likely to have contributed to the prevention of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the saving of lives." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Professor Louis Appleby, Director of the National Confidential Inquiry, said: "The community care reforms of the last decade seem to have had a positive impact on patient \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - providing more intensive support to the most vulnerable patients appears to have improved their survival." 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Peter Byrne, Associate Registrar at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: "We welcome this excellent study showing how local implementation of comprehensive mental health services reduces the number of people who die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . It proves the value of investing in safe psychiatric wards, close follow-up of discharged patients and specialized teams. In these difficult financial times, it is wrong to cut back on these essential mental health services when we need them the most."

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is not just a mental health problem affecting a few individuals anymore. Over the years, as more and more people take this extreme step, it has become a public health issue in India.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Keeping this in mind, the department of psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (Nimhans), launched a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  intervention and prevention workshop on Monday. It was attended by psychiatrists, psychologists and counsellors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Launching the initiative, Dr Satish Chandra, director and vice-chancellor, Nimhans, said the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in India is rising steadily. The rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in India which was 10.5 per 1,00,000 population in 2006 has gone up to 12.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is one of the serious concerns for over few decades now and doctors at Nimhans are working at various aspects of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention. While \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is common among urban and rural population across all age groups, Bangalore has emerged as the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  capital of the country," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It was high time to look into different attributing factors like globalisation, changing family values and stress level in individuals and deal with them, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention can be done when various gatekeepers of the society collectively take up the responsibility. Not just psychiatrists, panchayat leaders, religious leaders, media, general physicians, police, teachers, educational institutes and counsellors too have a role to play in preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in society," said Dr Shekhar Sheshadri, consultant psychiatrist, Nimhans.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Doctors from all specialties have an important role to play since certain chronic medical illnesses often trigger \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Dr Satish said.  Dr Lakshmi Vijayakumar, consultant psychiatrist, Sneha, Chennai, and honorary associate professor, University of Melbourne, said: "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention can be avoided as recent studies reveal that only 50% to 60% of the population committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has mental health disorder. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the remaining per cent of population can easily be avoided as they are due to momentary pressure, social scenario etc."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There was a notion that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  could  not be prevented, said Dr Vijayakumar.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, Norway, the UK and Sweden have shown decline in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates over the years with the help of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention programmes.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A NEWreport reveals a rise in the number of deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  nationally since 2008 and also shows that the number of deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in County Roscommon was above the national average between 2004-2008. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report by the National Office for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention (NOSP) revealed an increase in the number of deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  nationally since 2008.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to official data, 506 people died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2008 while provisional data now suggested that this number had increased to 527 in 2009 and may have fallen off to 486 in 2010. The report, however, suggested that the official data may show an even higher rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in both years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 An analysis of official data from 2004 to 2008 also showed that counties Cavan and Leitrim had the highest rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the country at between 17-18 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 population. During that period close to 2,400 people died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Ireland.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In County Roscommon the report found that 39 people died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  between 2004-2008 and that the number of deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 population (13.3) was above the national average (11.3) in the county.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nationally the report revealed a rise in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the middle age groups, both men and women, which the NOSP said was particularly worrying and attributed to stress and pressure on individuals due to the economic downturn.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The NOSP also found an increase in the number of people self harming with data recording close to 12,000 presentations of self harm to hospitals across the country in 2010.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report also detailed the range of measures and initiatives being taken throughout the country to offer assistance to people in crisis.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A national survey on suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adults made in 2008 and 2009 found wide variations by region, with, generally, more Westerners and Midwesterners contemplating \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than did Southerners or people in the Northeast. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report, released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is the first to look at suicidal thoughts, plans and attempts - rather than completed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - on a state-by-state basis.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 About 4.6 percent of adult Coloradans gave serious thought to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the previous year, compared with the national average of 3.7 percent. Utah had the highest rate of thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - 6.8 percent. Rhode Island was at the top for planning a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  even while reporting one of the lowest successful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in the nation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Overall, about 1 percent of American adults went so far as to make \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  plans, compared with 1.4 percent of Coloradans.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 About one-half percent - or about 1 million Americans - attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The research, gathered through the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, can be used by states to identify and improve their most effective \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -prevention strategies, the CDC report stated.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There are several theories as to why there are differences between the areas where a lot of people contemplate \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the areas where successful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is most common.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Demographics could be part of the answer. Women and young adults are more likely to think about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  while older men are more likely to succeed. The availability of guns or access to emergency health care could also affect the rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the U.S., 36,035 people died in 2008 as a result of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the report said. About 666,000 visited hospital emergency departments for nonfatal, self-inflicted injuries.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are steadily rising in Pakistan, with an estimated 6,000 to 8,000 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per year, according to a study at Aga Khan University (AKU). Almost 34 per cent of the population, mostly under 30 years of age, suffer from common mental disorders and more than 90 per cent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be linked to depression. These views were expressed by Dr Murad Moosa Khan, Chair and Professor, Department of Psychiatry, AKU, on the occasion of World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, held on September 10 every year, organised by the International Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention (IASP), in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO). 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He says WHO has estimated globally that there is one \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  death every two minutes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Talking about Pakistan, he said, "In Muslim countries, where \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates are generally seem to be lower, Pakistan stands as an anomaly. Growing socio-economic crisis, civil unrest and other social burdens have worsened the situation."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Government's inability to resolve these issues increases frustration, which converts to depression, he adds. One of the factors in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is hopelessness. The more depressed you are the more hopeless you become. The unsuccessful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts also have a psychological, social and economic cost. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 WHO estimates that the cost of attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , in terms of loss of productivity and health and social care, is billions of dollars per year. These attempts require medical treatment, and in many cases, render the main breadwinners incapable of earning a living, further burdening family income. "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  results from several factors, including mental illness, poverty, substance abuse, social isolation, losses, relationship difficulties and workplace problems. To be effective, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention needs an approach that acknowledges the multiple causes of suicidal behaviour," said Dr Khan. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is need for an immediate mental health intervention in Pakistan, he said, adding, "We need to reduce access to commonly used methods of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , which in Pakistan include pesticides or poisons." He said, "We also need to train government lady health workers to identify and report potential \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases as a pre-emptive measure. We need to spread education and awareness in communities and give support to people who have attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or have been affected by family members who have died from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The media can also play an extensive and very important role in helping us spread this awareness."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To understand the scope of the problem in Pakistan and to discuss the socio-economic, legal and other aspects of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention and Research Interest Group (SPRInG) at the University is organising a seminar and workshop on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 : Hidden Realities in Pakistan, to be held at the AKU Auditorium on Wednesday September 30.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The issue of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the Third Reich starts right at the top. When his New Order fell in ruins around him, Hitler killed himself, a fitting finale perhaps to a system that often seemed bent on self-destruction. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Then others followed - Goebbels (his wife and children, too), Himmler, G\'f6ring, and a host  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 of lesser National Socialist leaders. Even Rudolf Hess, locked away for life in 1946, managed to 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 kill himself in Spandau prison years later when 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 an old man.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This harvest of self-inflicted death was only the tip of the iceberg. In this fascinating if morbid book, Christian Goeschel offers a cool look at just why \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was so common under Hitler. There was not, of course, one explanation but many. Goeschel is keen to distance his argument from the classic study of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by the French social scientist Emile Durkheim, who linked \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with the crisis of values caused by the impact of modernity and soulless urbanism. Up until 1933 that may have been the case, he argues, with a spate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  following inflationary crisis and economic failure. But after 1933 the main explanation for a rising \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate was political.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The pressures took many forms. Goeschel shows that in the first wave of violence after 1933 many socialists and Jews took their own lives rather than face the thuggery and discrimination of the dictatorship. Some were helped on their way ('suicided' as Goeschel rather inelegantly puts it) by the SA bullies who rounded them up, but many were a genuine escape from what suddenly seemed an awful dead end. Jewish \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  remained high throughout the Third Reich, many a protest 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 against the anti-Semitism of the regime, others a way of achieving a dignified end, in which the individual, not the state, made the choice. Later, in the camps, attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was cruelly punished by the SS even days before victims were sent off to the gas chambers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Other \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were prompted by the draconian laws of the dictatorship. Individuals caught listening to the BBC during the war, or sleeping with foreign workers sometimes chose \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  over public shame or a prison sentence. Homosexuals committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to avoid castration or a spell 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 in a camp, from which thousands never returned.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There was even a spate of military \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as the war turned sour and soldiers sought the most desperate way out of their predicament. Still 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 other soldiers volunteered for what amounted to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  missions, though Goeschel does not rate these as \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Throughout the period there must also have been many 'regular' \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - men or women desperate about relationships, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at the loss of a son in the war, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as a result of mental illness. Goeschel does not dwell on these much, but it is clear that not all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  could be political, even if the individual chose to blame circumstances or the system in their \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  notes. There are also large questions about why \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was so prevalent in Germany. Figures supplied in the book show that British people were far less prone to finishing themselves off, which suggests that there are deeper cultural and social explanations at work than merely a response to debt or terror.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hitler led by example. It is tempting to say that he was always likely to kill himself. He tried to do so immediately after his failed Putsch in 1923 (a point that Goeschel might have made something of). His final death in the bunker was carefully prepared and his instructions obeyed to the letter. His was a coward's way out, leaving the German people to cope as best they might without their leader. But for thousands of others who killed themselves between 1933 and 1945 death simply seemed preferable to the squalid and vicious system they confronted.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Depression carries a high risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Anybody who expresses suicidal thoughts or intentions should be taken very seriously. Do not hesitate to call your local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  hotline immediately. Call 1-800-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 SUICIDE\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  (800-784-2433) or 1-800-273-TALK (800-273-8255)
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If you or someone you love has clinical depression, it's important to recognize the warning signs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention is highly possible. And there are signs to look for that say someone may be contemplating a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The best way to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with clinical depression is to know the risk factors for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and to recognize the warning signs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Take these signs seriously. Know how to respond to them. It could save someone's life.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a potentially preventable public health problem. It accounts for more than 1 percent of all deaths in the U.S. each year. In 2001, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was the 11th leading cause of death in the U.S.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Among young people age 15 to 24, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the third most common cause of death. Four times as many men die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as women. And 73 percent of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths are white males.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Risk factors for thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can vary with age, gender, and ethnic group. And risk factors often occur in combinations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 More than 90 percent of people who die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have clinical depression or another diagnosable mental disorder. Many times, people who die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have a substance abuse problem. Often they have that problem in combination with other mental disorders.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Adverse or traumatic life events in combination with other risk factors, such as clinical depression, may lead to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . But \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and suicidal behavior are never normal responses to stress.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Other risk factors for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  include:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   One or more prior \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Family history of mental disorder or substance abuse
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Family history of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Family violence
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Physical or sexual abuse
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Keeping firearms in the home
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Incarceration
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Exposure to the suicidal behavior of others
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Warning signs that someone may be thinking about or planning to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  include:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Always talking or thinking about death
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Clinical depression deep sadness, loss of interest, trouble sleeping and eating - that gets worse
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Having a "death wish," tempting fate by taking risks that could lead to death such as driving fast or running red lights
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Losing interest in things one used to care about
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Making comments about being hopeless, helpless, or worthless
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Putting affairs in order, tying up loose ends, changing a will
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Saying things like "It would be better if I wasn't here," or "I want out."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Sudden, unexpected switch from being very sad to being very calm or appearing to be happy
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Talking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or killing one's self
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0   Visiting or calling people to say good-bye
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Be especially concerned if a person is exhibiting any of these warning signs and has attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the past. According to the American Foundation for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention, between 20 percent and 50 percent of people who commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have had a previous attempt.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 What should you do if someone has signs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and clinical depression?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 First, if someone you know appears to be depressed and is contemplating \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , take that person seriously. Listen to what he or she is saying. Take the initiative to ask that person what he or she is planning. But don't attempt to argue him or her out of committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Rather, let the person know that you care and understand and are listening. Avoid statements like: "You have so much to live for."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If someone you know appears to be depressed and talks about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , makes a suicidal gesture, or attempts \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , take it as a serious emergency. Listen to the person, but don't try to argue with him or her. Seek immediate help from a health care professional.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Depressed people are often suicidal. It is a key symptom of the disease. Some studies show that the neurotransmitter serotonin plays a central role in the neurobiology of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Researchers have found lower levels of serotonin in the brainstem and cerebrospinal fluid of suicidal individuals.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In addition, suicidal behavior sometimes runs in families. Remember, any talk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is always an emergency. Have the person talk with a health care professional immediately.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sources of help for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and depression
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Encourage the person to seek the help of a mental health professional. Because the person probably doesn't think it's possible to be helped, you'll probably have to be persistent and go with that person.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If your loved one appears to be in imminent danger of committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , do not leave him or her alone. Remove any weapons or drugs he or she could use. Accompany him or her to the nearest emergency room.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 During treatment, be supportive. Help the person remember to take antidepressant medications and to continue any other therapy that's been prescribed.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SUICIDE\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is preventable and that is hope enough for us to do something, says Commissioner Western Joeli Rokovada.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate among Indo-Fijian women is now the third highest in the world. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He, however, said that since 2001 the number of completed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  decreased annually but there was still room for improvement. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , he said, represent a huge and complex public health problem.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A full understanding of the problem demanded the recognition that many factors that come together when a person attempts of completes \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , he added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Rokovada made the comments while celebrating World Mental Health Day in Ba yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Without treatment, the consequences of mental health for individual and society are staggering," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "From early childhood to late adulthood \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is bound to rear its ugly head through difficult circumstances that we encounter in life. Annual statistics of fatal and non fatal \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Fiji have showed that it affects people as young as pre-schoolers to people over 65 years."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Rokovada said learning the early warnings of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was one way of saving individuals and loved ones from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said the Health Ministry was committed to lead and support the National Committee on the Prevention of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  (NCOPS) in all its activities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said they would step up efforts to implement the various strategies identified to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The national committee alone cannot tackle the high incidence of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  therefore it is calling upon all stakeholders, including groups at all levels, to unite against \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," he said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Researchers Michelle Moskos, Intermountain Injury Control Research Center; Jennifer Achilles, U. School of Medicine; and Doug Gray, U. Department of Psychiatry, conducted the study to separate fact from fiction and to offer recommendations for future prevention programs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Their conclusions include the following:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Myth: \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is caused by family and social stress such as loss, rejection or discipline.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: Those events are common in a teenager's life, and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a rare outcome.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 People often attribute \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to breaking up with a boyfriend or girlfriend, arguments with parents or disciplinary action.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Teenagers who kill themselves do have more stress and family dysfunction, but at least 90 percent have a mental illness. Furthermore, mental illness runs in families.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "is caused" by an interplay of biological, psychological, environmental and social factors, according to the study.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Myth: \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempters and completers are the same.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: Males are four times as likely to die from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but females are more likely to attempt it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Current \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention efforts do not focus on high-risk groups, the study shows. School programs that consist of a brief, one-time lecture are not effective. Females use crisis hotlines more than males, thus having little effect on those most at risk.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reduced access to guns may be one of the "most promising underused strategies" in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Unfortunately, a recent study demonstrated that only 25 percent of gun owners remove firearms from their home when repeatedly asked to do so by their teenager's mental health provider."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Myth: Current prevention programs work.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: School education programs, teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  hotlines and efforts to limit firearms access have not significantly lowered teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The majority of teens who kill themselves have never made a prior attempt, the researchers wrote. And boys are more likely than girls to die from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  because they use lethal means such as guns. That and cultural influences that make it more acceptable for males to take their lives account for their higher \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Myth: \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is not inherited.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: Genetics has a critical role in mental illness and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Some families have increased risk for depression over generations, while others have increased risk for depression and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Future prevention programs need to focus on predispositions to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the researchers say.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Myth: Teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  represents treatment failure.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: Studies indicate few \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  completers were in treatment at the time of their deaths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Government data showed that 1 percent of teenagers who took their lives were in public mental health treatment and 3 percent had psychotropic drugs in their systems.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The leveling off of youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  coincides with increased use of antidepressants and mood stabilizers. There is no proof of a causal link, but other known risk factor such as divorce or substance abuse were unchanged.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Parents identified the stigma of mental illness and the denial of mental illness as the most significant barrier between teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  completers and treatment."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Myth: Teenagers have the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Fact: Elderly white males have always had the highest rate, but adolescent rates more than tripled between the 1960s and 1990s.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is one of the leading causes of death for teenagers. In addition, cluster \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occur predominantly with teens. The researchers found that a lack of appropriate treatment or compliance with treatment for mental illness leads to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rather than the illness alone.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Moskos, Achilles and Gray say the six myths they identified show better research is needed to combat the high teenage \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate, and that too often \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention programs aren't designed, implemented and evaluated with appropriate supporting research.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Psychiatric illnesses are often viewed differently from other medical problems. Public awareness, researchers said, could close the gap between the perception of mental and physical illness as separate issues. E-mail: lucy@desnews.com; romboy@desnews.com

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Grim new \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  figures show a rocketing rate of female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and reveal Nelson Marlborough has one of the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in the country. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The latest national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  figures released yesterday by Associate Health Minister Jim Anderton show Nelson Marlborough has the fifth highest rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the country with 14.3 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 people. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hawke's Bay had the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate during the 2001 - 2003 period with 18 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 people, and Auckland had the lowest with eight \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nelson Marlborough also had the eighth highest rate of hospitalisations from intentional self harm.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nationally, the figures show a 25 percent increase in female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in one year - a phenomenon \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  experts put down to women behaving more like men.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Information New Zealand director Merryn Statham said the figures were ``awful''.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ``It's a complete tragedy for all of the families in those communities. Any increase is an indication of the distress felt in families.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, Ms Statham was one of several experts who was not surprised by the increase in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  amongst women.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ``Many of the young women who are experiencing significant difficulty in their lives are adopting more masculine behaviours.'' She said some females were adopting more lethal methods in attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , which might have partly caused the increase.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 More lethal methods included hanging and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  involving firearms.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There was no single factor behind the increases, she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Canterbury \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Project director Dr Annette Beautrais had also noticed some women were adopting historically masculine tendencies.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ``Young females are becoming much more like males in many ways. If they move to more lethal methods, then it is likely a bigger proportion of them will die,'' she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 by Associate Health Minister Jim Anderton. In total, 515 people died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - up almost 10 percent on 2002.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Men's figures continued to be high, with 374 deaths - up 24 on 2002.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The figures have sparked calls for more up-to-date information on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and the rate at which it is killing people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Beautrais said she was ``disappointed'' by the overall figures.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ``We had a steady decline from 1996, so (going by that) we would have expected to see a reduction - instead we saw a rise of 50. We hope this is an aberration.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Beautrais said better follow-up care for those who had attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was needed to help stem the increase.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Maori men continued to have a high rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , with 20.4 deaths per 100,000 people, compared with 15.6 deaths for non-Maori men.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While the statistics were concerning, long-term trends indicated that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates were levelling off, Mr Anderton said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ``We need to maintain our focus on finding out as much as we can about what causes \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and what is effective in helping to prevent it.''
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Anderton said there were several initiatives under way to help prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but acknowledged that the reasons people took their own life were often very complex.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Government has set aside $10.3 million for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention spending between 2005 and 2009. A further $6 million would be spent on the National Depression Initiative in the same period.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Government is pledging to act on a new study that has found \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  costs the country $1.4 billion a year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Associate Health Minister Jim Anderton said yesterday that the "huge" cost to New Zealand of its \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempted-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates -- among the highest in the world -- was almost half as much as the bill for the nation's road toll.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the latest figures available (2002), 460 New Zealanders killed themselves and 5095 attempted to take their own lives. That is higher than the number of people killed on the roads this year. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Government yesterday released six reports on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that examined the cost and a range of possible social influences on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Anderton said the reports would be used by the Government as guidance on how to spend the $10.3 million earmarked for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention between 2005 and 2009.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said there was no easy answer to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I'm not a psychiatrist, so I can't work out whether we have a gloomy propensity or not," Anderton said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "But we do have to ask ourselves some questions. Do we always see things as glass half-empty rather than glass half-full? Do we celebrate success rather than anticipate failure? I think in many ways there are some cultural issues."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the first attempt to put a dollar cost on the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate, Wellington School of Medicine and Health Sciences economist Des O'Dea found the direct economic cost of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to the workforce was $238.5m. He then used Land Transport Safety Authority figures for the statistical value of a life, which last year was $2.7m.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 O'Dea put the non-economic cost per \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at $2.4m and the direct economic cost at $448,000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 O'Dea found each attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cost society $32,000, adding up to a total cost of $1.38b in lives taken or attempts made.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Anderton said putting an economic cost on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  allowed direct comparisons with road accidents for the first time. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  costs society dearly," he said. "While the direct economic costs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are not insignificant, they are dwarfed by the intangible costs -- the loss to family and friends and the lost potential from lives cut prematurely short."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The other reports released by the Government collated research on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in New Zealand, concluding that social factors such as poverty, age and ethnicity have an influence on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The authors have urged caution over their findings, saying there are possible associations of some social indicators (for example, fluctuations in gross domestic product, unemployment rates) with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates, but they were "not statistically significant".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Anderton said he was sure there was an association.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A study comparing youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in New Zealand and Finland found that while both countries experienced a severe economic recession in the 1980s and early 1990s, only in New Zealand did youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates rise.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The study authors concluded that this was because Finland stepped up its welfare assistance during the recession, while New Zealand's was scaled back.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Another study found significant regional variation in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates, with the highest being the West Coast (27.2 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 people) and the lowest Taranaki (16.9).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Canterbury was fourth highest at 21.5, ahead of Auckland on 20 and Wellington on 18.9.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While some data pointed to the higher rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in rural areas, the reason for this could be greater access to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  methods such as poisons and guns, the study said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Maori \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates were similar to non-Maori until the mid-1990s, after which the Maori rate had risen.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The study noted there had been an "alarming increase" in the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among 15 to 29-year-olds in the past 20 years, overtaking the 30-39 age group.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The reports are hamstrung by a lack of recent data, with most using 1999 figures because of a lag in coroner's statistics becoming available.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This Friday, World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, a network of crisis lines across British Columbia will be announcing a new 1-800-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 SUICIDE\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  toll-free \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention service. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Distress Line Network of British Columbia (DLN), a partnership of independent crisis lines from across B.C., has initiated the new 1-800-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 SUICIDE\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  service to help ensure \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -related callers do not receive a busy signal when they call.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a press release, Ian Ross, executive director of the Crisis Intervention and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Centre of B.C. in Vancouver said the aim of the new service is that no \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -related calls go unanswered.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He pointed out that callers to crisis lines need help immediately and the 1-800-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 SUICIDE\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention service will help ensure British Columbians receive the help they need when they call. He added that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is most often the result of pain, hopelessness and despair. If people are reaching out for help, it is important they connect with a human voice.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Anyone in B.C. who calls 1-800-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 SUICIDE\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will be connected to the nearest distress line in the network. If busy, the call will be redirected to the next available distress line partner. Calls will be answered by an experienced volunteer, trained in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  risk assessment and supported by a team of professionals.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Currently, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -related calls represent between six and 10 per cent of all calls to crisis centres in British Columbia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Linda Stanton, co-director of NEED Crisis and Information Line in Victoria stated in the release that the system will streamline \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention and response in B.C.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It will not replace existing crisis lines; rather, it adds to the service continuum another access point for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -related calls. She said the DLN's goal is to enhance crisis intervention and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention services in B.C.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Funding for the 1-800-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 SUICIDE\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  project was donated by the BC Hydro Employees' Community Services Fund (HYDRECS fund), the Vancouver Foundation and Telus.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Distress Line Network of British Columbia is a partnership of independent crisis centres covering every health region in the province, working together to provide a seamless \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  response for British Columbians. Members include the Crisis Intervention & \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Centre of B.C.; the Crisis Prevention, Intervention & Information Centre for Northern B.C.; Kelowna Community Resources; Mission Community Services; and NEED Crisis & Information Line. Each Distress Line is certified by the American Association of Suicidology.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Four civic groups yesterday joined hands to fight \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as part of a global initiative to mark the first World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day today.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Hong Kong's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate reached a record high last year with 16.4 of every 100,000 people dying by their own hand.  This exceeded the global average of 14.5 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  An agreement to step up co-operation to devise measures to curb \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was signed by the heads of the Samaritan Befrienders Hong Kong, the Samaritans Multi-Lingual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Service, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Services and the Hong Kong Jockey Club Centre for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Research and Prevention of the Hong Kong University.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The agreement is part of a global initiative to fight \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - currently the 13th leading cause of death worldwide - led by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the International Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The WHO and the association have designated today World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  According to the WHO, about 815,000 people killed themselves worldwide in 2000 - one death every 40 seconds.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Representatives from Hong Kong will join delegates from more than 30 countries in Stockholm today to discuss the growing problem.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Speaking from Sweden yesterday, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention association president Diego De Leo said the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate worldwide was worrying and he hoped they could help save more lives by strengthening international co-operation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The agreement signed by the four local groups yesterday included plans to meet every three months to co-ordinate efforts to raise community awareness and provide more training opportunities for general practitioners, medical health workers, teachers and parents.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Paul Yip Siu-fai, director of the Hong Kong University's centre for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  research and prevention, attributed the surge in local \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  partly to the economic downturn, pointing out that an increasing number of middle-aged people were killing themselves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He said about 40 per cent of last year's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occurred among people aged from 30 to 49 years old, twice the proportion seen in 1997.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 IN 1999, a news report in a British paper described how two men died after
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 drinking the contents of a bottle they thought was cherry brandy. In fact
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 it contained anti-freeze which is lethal.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Following this report, it was found that there was an increased number
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 of attempts to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by drinking anti-freeze - an unusual method
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 of taking one's life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 These and other such stories, have led Kathryn Williams and Keith Hawton
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 of the Centre for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Research at Oxford University, to conclude that
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 media coverage of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  lead to actual incidents of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In their study Suicidal Behaviour and the Media they found that the
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 number of people who took their own lives increased after dramatic reports
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the media, particularly of celebrities and teenagers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The study drew on research literature on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from 26 countries,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 going back 150 years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Asian countries such as Malaysia and India where there are no studies
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  the researchers communicated with local academics and
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 psychologists to complete their report.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Media influences \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  particularly if the news coverage is given
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 prominence, is repeated, or describes in detail the method of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although media reports (do not directly) cause \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  they can and do
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 lead to imitative suicidal behaviour by those who have suicidal
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 tendencies.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It was found that responsible reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  helped reduce such
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 incidences. In contrast, where newspapers specify the method of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 there was an increased usage of that method in at least 21 of 30 reports.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ten out of 13 studies conducted in the United States, showed a link
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 between television news reports and suicidal behaviour in the community.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Soap operas and television documentaries were also found to have an
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 effect.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For instance in Austria, a documentary on the stress train drivers face
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 worrying about potential \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  saw an increase in the number of people
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 throwing themselves in front of trains in the one week following the
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 story.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The study also found that whether a news report on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  led to
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 imitative suicidal behaviour depends on its content and presentation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Influential aspects include whether the method of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is described,
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 the amount of publicity the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  receives, how much the media
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 sensationalises the story, whether the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victim is a celebrity or an
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 ordinary person, if pictures are used, whether the story is real or
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 fictional and the way in which \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is portrayed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Stories about real \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were over four times more likely to find an
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 imitative effect compared to fictional presentations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Stories that are given prominence, and are repetitive demonstrated
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 significantly greater increases in the American \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates with each
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 additional day that a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  story was published.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Six studies in Japan demonstrated that wide coverage over multiple media
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 on the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of a school student and pop singer, influenced an increase
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 in the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the country.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Some audiences were found to be more vulnerable than others to
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 imitation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The likelihood of this appears to be enhanced when the audience can
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 identify with the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victim in some way.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On the other hand, the study found that changes to the way \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  news
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 is reported can help prevent people taking their own lives.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For instance, when the media in Vienna and Toronto voluntarily refrained
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 from reporting subway \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  the number of such \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  dropped

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A Victorian study has found that it is almost impossible to detect young people most at risk of successfully committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  because so few characteristics were common to all cases. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One of the few clues to successful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , particularly by young males, is that almost 90 per cent did not seek help - a finding that offers little hope for the taskforce that has been set up to determine risk factors and to develop prevention strategies.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 More than 100 Victorians under the age of 25 commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report, which was presented to the taskforce last month, recommends a community awareness campaign, similar to the Transport Accident Commission advertisements, to encourage parents to adopt a sympathetic approach and to teach young people to seek help from families, friends and doctors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Associate Professor John Tiller, from the University of Melbourne's department of psychiatry, said: "It is very difficult to predict who will commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and when. And it is almost impossible to identify the individual who will \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report's findings dispel commonly held beliefs that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is higher among the unemployed, homeless or drug and alcohol-users.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The study, to be published later this year, looked at 148 youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , from coroner's reports, and 206 attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , from hospital records. It found that unemployment was mentioned as a reason for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in less than 5 per cent of cases.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Tiller said the most common method of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is hanging or carbon monoxide poisoning - accounting for 55 per cent of deaths. Firearms accounted for 20 per cent of deaths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The 1993-94 study found that more than half of the young people who committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  lived at home and most did not use excessive amounts of alcohol or drugs.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 WHY IT'S HARD TO HEAD OFF YOUTH \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 SUICIDES\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Almost 90 per cent of those who committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  did not seek help first.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Fewer than half of those were homeless.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * A history of physical or sexual abuse was common among those who attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but was not characteristic of successful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Young male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were not precipitated by an event such as a broken relationship or an arguement.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 PERTH: Attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among Australian men rose an alarming 70 per cent in 15 years, latest figures from South Australia and WA indicate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Professor Robert Kosky, of the Adelaide Children's Hospital, said the figures showed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts no longer were behavior associated with young women. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He said recent figures from Perth showed that the overall \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate for men had risen above the rate for women and was now 1.3 to one.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  There was a great increase in attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among men aged 40 to 45 years, he said, and figures showed similar attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates among men in Adelaide in 1986-1987.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Professor Kosky also criticised the official South Australian attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  figures.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He said they recorded only about 30 per cent of attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases admitted to hospital, adding that hospital clerks were instructed in 1988 not to record attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unless hospital registrars indicated there was an intent to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Professor Kosky said he believed alcohol and changes to family structures were behind the higher rate of men attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  He said that in 1971-72, 185 Perth men in every 100,000 were treated in hospitals after attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  About 200 women in every 100,000 living in Perth were treated after an attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  over the same period.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But Professor Kosky said that in 1986-87 the rate of attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among Perth men had jumped nearly 70 per cent. The rate among women increased only slightly.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Professor Kosky said three main factors led to attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 : depressive illness, chronic family problems and alcohol.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Geneva, Switzerland (PANA) - The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for a coordinated action to reduce \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  worldwide, with more than 800,000 people dying by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every year - around one person every 40 seconds.  
\par \pard 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 PANA reported that the call was contained in a statement issued Thursday to announce the WHO's first global report on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, published the same day. 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 It said some 75% of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occur in low- and middle-income countries, and that pesticide poisoning, hanging and firearms are among the most common methods of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  globally.  
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 According to the report, evidence from Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the United States and a number of European countries reveals that limiting access to these means can help prevent people dying by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .  
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Another key to reducing deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a commitment by national governments to the establishment and implementation of a coordinated plan of action. Currently, only 28 countries are known to have national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategies. 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Other effective measures of reducing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths include responsible reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the media, such as avoiding language that sensationalises \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and avoiding explicit description of methods used, and early identification and management of mental and substance use disorders in communities and by health workers in particular. 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Follow-up care by health workers through regular contact, including by phone or home visits, for people who have attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , together with provision of community support, are essential, because people who have already attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are at the greatest risk of trying again. 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 The WHO reports said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occurs all over the world and can take place at almost any age.  
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Globally, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates are highest in people aged 70 years and over. In some countries, however, the highest rates are found among the young. Notably, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the second leading cause of death in 15-29 year-olds globally. 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 "This report is a call for action to address a large public health problem which has been shrouded in taboo for far too long" said WHO Director-General Margaret Chan. 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 The report also said generally, more men die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than women. In richer countries, three times as many men die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than women. Men aged 50 years and over are particularly vulnerable.
\par \pard 
\par \pard 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 In low- and middle-income countries, young adults and elderly women have higher rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than their counterparts in high-income countries. Women over 70 years old are more than twice as likely to die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than women aged 15-29 years.
\par \pard 
\par \pard 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 WHO recommends countries involve a range of government departments in developing a comprehensive coordinated response, saying high-level commitment is needed not just within the health sector, but also within education, employment, social welfare and judicial departments. 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 "This report, the first WHO publication of its kind, presents a comprehensive overview of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts and successful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention efforts worldwide. We know what works. Now is the time to act," said Dr Shekhar Saxena, Director of the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse at WHO. 
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 The report's launch comes just a week before World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, observed on 10 Sept. every year, to provide an opportunity for joint action to raise awareness about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention around the world.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 About eight people a day die from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Florida.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A national anti-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  group is taking a stand - or, rather, a walk - to remind Jacksonville that number is too high, but there are ways to help bring that count to zero. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Jacksonville Out of the Darkness walk will begin at The Jacksonville Landing at 7:30 a.m. on Saturday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The walk, which ends around noon, will support that American Foundation for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention by supporting local and national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention and awareness programs, according to an organization press release.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Those who walk are asked to pledge a fundraising goal, but participants can fulfill their donation pledge until Dec. 31.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Participants can register online at outofthedarkness.org or in person on the day of the walk.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nationwide, about 700,000 people will attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year, and about 38,000 people will die from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Florida, 39,000 people attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a year, and about 2,800 people die a year, according to the Florida \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Coalition.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Duval County, 14.5 deaths are due to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year per 100,000 people, according to Northeast Florida Counts. There are 20.3 deaths a year in Nassau County, 23.1 deaths a year in Baker County, 16.2 deaths a year in Clay County and 18.2 deaths a year in St. Johns.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the eighth-leading cause of death in Jacksonville, the ninth-leading cause of death in Florida and the 10th-leading cause of death in the U.S., said Liz Colavecchio, chairwoman of the American Foundation for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention's First Coast Chapter.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Despite the troubling statistics, an important goal of the walk is to stress that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be prevented.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The walk also is a call to action that more must be done to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , nationally and in communities across the country," said Robert Gebbia, executive director for the American Foundation for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention, in a statement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If you or someone you know is having thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , you can find someone to talk with at the National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Lifeline, (800) 273-8255.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dear Doctor K: My husband suffers from severe depression, and I am worried he might take his own life. How do I know if my fears are warranted?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dear Reader: Most people who commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are depressed. But most people who are depressed don't commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . We can't predict who will commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but experts observe that certain factors increase a person's risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Family history. People with a close blood relative who has committed or attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have a much higher than average risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  also is higher if close relatives have had a history of any type of mental illness or violent acts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Access to guns. Having a gun in the home makes \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  more likely.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Substance abuse. Alcohol or drug use can erase inhibitions and anxiety that might help keep \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at bay.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Previous attempts. People who have attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are more likely to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than those who haven't tried it before.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A significant life change. A change in a person's life also can abruptly increase their risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . For example:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 -  A significant loss, such as the death of a spouse or loss of a job.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 -  Loss of social support, for example, because of a move.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 -  A personal crisis, such as a divorce.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 -  An illness or medication that triggers a change in mood.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 -  The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of a friend, peer or celebrity.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Setting affairs in order. Finally, there is a warning sign that is paradoxical and dangerously misleading. Has your husband recently sorted out his finances, given away mementos, or called or visited loved ones? Along with these activities, has he seemed calmer and happier lately?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Of course, you want your husband to be happy. But if he seems suddenly happier and is doing things that people do as they approach the end of their life, be really worried. Rather than being a sign of returning health, his happiness may indicate that he is at peace - after having made a final decision.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Hemlock Society is dedicated to the view that there are at least    two forms of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  One is emotional \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  (or irrational    self-murder) in all its complexities. Let me emphasize that the Hemlock    Society view on that form of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is to prevent it where you can. We    do not encourage \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for reasons of poor mental health or    unhappiness. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      We say that there is a second form of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide:\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  justifiable \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  That is, rational and planned self-deliverance; put another way, this    is auto-euthanasia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      What the Hemlock Society and its supporters are talking about is    auto-euthanasia. But we also have to face up to the fact it is called    \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by law. (\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is not a crime in the English-speaking world,    neither is attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but assistance in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for any reason    remains a crime. Even if the helper is acting from the best motives, it    remains a crime in the Anglo-American world.)        \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for the following reasons can be justified ethically by the    average Hemlock Society supporter:         Advanced terminal illness that is causing unbearable suffering to    the individual. This is the most common reason for self-deliverance.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      What are the ethical parameters for auto-euthanasia? The person    should:         Be a mature adult.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       Have clearly made a considered decision.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       Have already sought medical help.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       Inform the treating physician and take his response into account.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       Have made a will disposing of his worldly effects.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       Plan the exit from this life without involving others in criminal    liability.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       Leave a note saying exactly why he or she is self-destructing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      Having considered the logic in favor of auto-euthanasia, the person    should also address the countervailing arguments:        Should the person go into a hospice? Put bluntly, hospices make the    best of a bad job, and they do so with great skill and love. The    euthanasia movement supports their work. Not everyone wants that form    of treatment, and hospice care cannot make dying into a beautiful    experience although it tries hard to do so. A hospice really means    appropriate medicine and care, which everybody deserves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      Another consideration is the question: Does suffering ennoble? Is    suffering a part of life and a preparation for death? Our response here    is that if that is your firm belief, then you are not a candidate for    voluntary euthanasia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      Another consideration is whether, by checking out before the Grim    Reaper calls, you are depriving yourself of a valuable period of life    and also depriving your family and friends of your love and    companionship? Practitioners of active voluntary euthanasia almost    always wait until a late stage in the dying process; some even wait too    long and go into a coma and are frustrated in self-deliverance.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      From my years in the Hemlock Society, hearing the feedback of    hundreds, maybe thousands, of cases, I can assure you that most    believers in euthanasia do enjoy life, love living, and their feeling    of the sanctity of life is as strong as anybody's.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      Yet they are willing, if their dying is distressing to them, to    forgo a few weeks of the end and leave under their own control.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 About eight people a day die from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Florida.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A national anti-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  group is taking a stand - or, rather, a walk - to remind Jacksonville that number is too high, but there are ways to help bring that count to zero. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Jacksonville Out of the Darkness walk will begin at The Jacksonville Landing at 7:30 a.m. on Saturday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The walk, which ends around noon, will support that American Foundation for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention by supporting local and national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention and awareness programs, according to an organization press release.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Those who walk are asked to pledge a fundraising goal, but participants can fulfill their donation pledge until Dec. 31.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Participants can register online at outofthedarkness.org or in person on the day of the walk.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nationwide, about 700,000 people will attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year, and about 38,000 people will die from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Florida, 39,000 people attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a year, and about 2,800 people die a year, according to the Florida \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Coalition.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In Duval County, 14.5 deaths are due to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year per 100,000 people, according to Northeast Florida Counts. There are 20.3 deaths a year in Nassau County, 23.1 deaths a year in Baker County, 16.2 deaths a year in Clay County and 18.2 deaths a year in St. Johns.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the eighth-leading cause of death in Jacksonville, the ninth-leading cause of death in Florida and the 10th-leading cause of death in the U.S., said Liz Colavecchio, chairwoman of the American Foundation for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention's First Coast Chapter.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Despite the troubling statistics, an important goal of the walk is to stress that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be prevented.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The walk also is a call to action that more must be done to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , nationally and in communities across the country," said Robert Gebbia, executive director for the American Foundation for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention, in a statement.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If you or someone you know is having thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , you can find someone to talk with at the National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Lifeline, (800) 273-8255.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One person in the world dies by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every 40 seconds, according to the first comprehensive report on the issue from the World Health Organisation, which talks of a massive toll of tragic and preventable deaths. 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates vary enormously between countries - influenced by the cultural, social, religious and economic environments in which people live, and sometimes want to stop living. Some of the worst-affected countries have more than 40 times more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than the least-affected areas.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Overall, the Geneva-based UN body estimates that there are at least 800,000 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a year. But many countries do not collect good data, there is huge stigma and in a few nations \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is still illegal, so it is highly likely the numbers are an underestimate. Criminalising \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  does not prevent it; India, where it is illegal, has one of the higher \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in the world at almost 21 deaths per 100,000 people against a global average of 11.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the second leading cause of death among people aged 15-29, but \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates rise in people older than 50. It is more common in men than women, though the disparity is greater in rich countries than poorer ones. Three-quarters of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occur in low- and middle-income countries, with higher numbers in central and eastern Europe and in Asia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The WHO wants all countries to have a national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategy, which must include reducing access to the means of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Only 28 countries say that they have a national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategy.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I, like countless others, was deeply saddened to learn of the Aug. 11 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of the beloved actor and comedian, Robin Williams.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 His \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has moved us to feel, reflect, write and talk about the tragedy of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . As too many of us know, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is not only a risk factor for those who are rich and famous. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  touches us in our own homes, workplaces and communities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Alberta Centre for Injury Control and Research reports that more than 500 people in Alberta die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year. This number is more than the number of deaths by motor vehicle accidents and homicides combined. Over 75 per cent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths are male and 69 per cent of men who kill themselves are between the ages of 30 and 69. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is important that each and every one of us take responsibility to educate ourselves about mental health, depression, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the myths and facts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and resources in our community.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 2013, The Centre for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention published a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention primer that helps us understand those myths and facts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For example, are you afraid to ask someone directly if they are thinking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , fearing that it will influence or cause a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to occur?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In fact, talking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to someone who may be suicidal reduces the risk of a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 How do we know when to start a conversation about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ? IS PATH WARM is a mnemonic developed by the American Association of Suicidology that helps us remember suicidal warning signs: IS (ideation, substance abuse) PATH (purposelessness, anxiety, trapped, hopelessness) WARM (withdrawal, anger, recklessness, mood changes).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Canadian Mental Health Association - Edmonton Region offers the internationally accredited ASSIST (Applied \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Intervention Skills Training) and Mental Health First Aid, a program of the Mental Health Association of Canada.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 People in distress can call Edmonton's Distress Line at 780-482-HELP.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is non-discriminatory; there is no 'type' to die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Anyone can experience depression or a series of events and experiences that lead to feelings of hopelessness and despair.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Social isolation, being the target of homophobia and transphobia, bullying, marginalization and a lack of acceptance for our very natures are risk factors for some groups. The Alberta Teachers' Association (the provincial Healthy Minds Bright Futures partnership with CMHA) and the Society for Safe and Caring Schools Communities are addressing these issues within school communities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day is Sept. 10. A group of aligned community organizations is working together to plan \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  awareness and prevention during Lift the Silence \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Awareness Week (Sept. 8-12) in Edmonton. Everyone is welcome to attend and join the conversation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It is impossible to measure the human cost of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; the pain and suffering of those who die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the measure of grief of those who have lost a loved one to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , or the lives which have been changed by not having the nurturing, mentorship, mothering or fathering of someone who has died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Economists have measured that the material costs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and self-inflicted injuries are $3.36 billion in Alberta alone.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There are many reasons that people don't reach out for help. Sometimes they do, and we don't see the signs or may be afraid to talk about it because we don't know what to do. Sometimes the stigma of mental illness stops people from reaching out or seeing how serious a situation is. People may be afraid of losing a job if they talk about their depression at work. People may go to hospital and there is no psychiatrist or hospital bed for them.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We do a lot for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention in our community and province, but our efforts are fragmented. If we want to significantly change the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in our community we need: Open and easy access to free mental health services, including early depression screening and treatment; To limit access to lethal means; Education, including technical training for clinicians and service providers as well as public awareness campaigns; A champion and leader to co-ordinate, facilitate and support a provincial response to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We can each make a difference. Know the signs, start the conversation and reach out.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dear Doctor K: My husband suffers from severe depression, and I am worried he might take his own life. How do I know if my fears are warranted?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dear Reader: Most people who commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are depressed. But most people who are depressed don't commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . We can't predict who will commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but experts observe that certain factors increase a person's risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Family history. People with a close blood relative who has committed or attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have a much higher than average risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  also is higher if close relatives have had a history of any type of mental illness or violent acts.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Access to guns. Having a gun in the home makes \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  more likely.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Substance abuse. Alcohol or drug use can erase inhibitions and anxiety that might help keep \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at bay.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Previous attempts. People who have attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are more likely to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than those who haven't tried it before.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A significant life change. A change in a person's life also can abruptly increase their risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . For example:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 -  A significant loss, such as the death of a spouse or loss of a job.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 -  Loss of social support, for example, because of a move.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 -  A personal crisis, such as a divorce.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 -  An illness or medication that triggers a change in mood.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 -  The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of a friend, peer or celebrity.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Setting affairs in order. Finally, there is a warning sign that is paradoxical and dangerously misleading. Has your husband recently sorted out his finances, given away mementos, or called or visited loved ones? Along with these activities, has he seemed calmer and happier lately?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Of course, you want your husband to be happy. But if he seems suddenly happier and is doing things that people do as they approach the end of their life, be really worried. Rather than being a sign of returning health, his happiness may indicate that he is at peace - after having made a final decision.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 NEW England and North West communities grappling with the issue of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have been given a helping hand with the release of a new resource outlining a raft of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategies. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mental Health Minister Kevin Humphries this week launched Communities Matter: A toolkit for community-driven \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, which supports people living in small communities to work together to combat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , as well as break the stigma surrounding \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by encouraging people to reach out to one another.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There would be few people in regional NSW that haven't been touched by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in some way," Mr Humphries said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Like many people who have lived in regional communities all their life, I know too many families who have tragically lost loved ones to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "With 550 lives lost to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in NSW every year it is important to break the stigma surrounding \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and to help small communities to both work to prevent acts of self-harm and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , as well as deal with the impacts when they occur."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Tomorrow is World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day. To coincide with the day, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Australia will launch a range of activities and resources. These resources will aim to educate Australians to look out for each other and be aware of the signs of mental illness and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and how they could potentially save a life.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Available for free, they will further encourage people Australia-wide to discuss mental illness and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention while removing the stigma of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Chairman of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Australia Michael Dudley said that the resources were developed to get people talking to each other and raising awareness about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention. ``The resources approach \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  not as a forbidden or taboo topic; they are colourful, informative and provide potentially life-saving information in a clear and concise way," Dr Dudley said. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Australia chief executive Ryan McGlaughlin reiterated Dr Dudley's notions, and added that many Australians want to learn how to talk about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  so that they can help to prevent it. ``They want to be empowered with tools to be able to help when they see someone in need," he said. ``We are hoping with the knowledge and discussions which may come about from these resources, we will challenge the taboo of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the stereotypes surrounding mental illness. ``We are encouraging people to open up and ask for help when they need it _ to do this we need people to be understanding and supportive." All information and resources are available on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Australia's World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day website _ www.wspd.org.au The website also links to resources from SANE Australia, which is a national mental health charity, where users can find authoritative explanations for a range of mental health problems, including \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention related issues. Both Dr Dudley and Mr McGlaughlin strongly encouraged all individuals, organisations and community groups to get involved in downloading the resources, getting to know the signs, as well as where and how to get help. _ Information courtesy of www.suicidepreventionaust.org

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 India, Aug. 28 -- The mention of the term \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bomber often brings to mind the image of flag-swathed Japanese fighter pilots taking their ritual oath before boarding their fighter planes during World War II. They were called Kamikaze, a Japanese word that means 'divine wind'. They weren't the first, however. Long before the Kamikazes began crashing their planes into enemy warships, the phenomenon of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attack was introduced in the 17th century by the Dutch army while fighting Koxinga's forces. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In modern times, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombings have become more a weapon of terror than heroism in the battlefield. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) were the first guerrilla force to have adopted the tactic of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attacks, with the so called Black Tigers. India lost a prime minister to a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attack carried out by the LTTE. There has hardly been any region in this world which has not been hit by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombings. Israel has also been particularly prone to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombings, carried out by the members of PFLP (Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine). It has been reported that between 2000 and 2006, PFLP received more applications for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombers than it needed. The Chechen rebels have used \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attacks on several occasions in their conflict against the Russian government.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At present, the Taliban and al-Qaeda are the terrorist groups that have repeatedly resorted to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attacks to create havoc; 9/11 was their most terrible attack ever, one that has certainly changed the history of the world.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Robert Pape, director of the Chicago Project on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Terrorism, believes that most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attacks in recent times have the same specific strategic goal: to cause an occupying state to withdraw forces from a disputed territory. Islamic terrorist organisations propagate that if a fighter becomes a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attacker then he/she will earn a place in heaven. According to a report compiled by the Chicago Project on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Terrorism, most of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attacks in the last decade have either been launched by Islamic terror groups or been staged in Muslim majority nations. The tag for carrying out the largest number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attacks still stays with LTTE, even though they were militarily wiped out two years ago.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Afghanistan and Pakistan have mostly been at the receiving end of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attacks in recent times. Pakistan has had around 30 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attacks till now in 2011, most recent being the bombing of a mosque in the town of Jamrud that claimed 48 lives. What shocked the whole world is that the attacks took place in the holy month of Ramadan. On August 19, a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attack was carried out at the compound of the British council in Kabul, Afghanistan, as well.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Among Canadian provinces, Quebec is dead last in the fight against \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But a 32-per-cent drop in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in the past decade provides tangible evidence that prevention programs are working.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That is the major conclusion of a public-health study on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unveiled yesterday at a news conference to kick off \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Week.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Twenty years ago, hardly anyone dared mention the word \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," said Bruno Marchand, director of the 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Association qu\'e9b\'e9coise de pr\'e9vention du \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "But keeping a lid on the problem didn't help."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Increased public awareness is one reason why the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate among Quebec youths age 15 to 19 dropped by an average of 12 per cent each year from 1999 to 2008, Marchand said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The province now has 33 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -prevention centres, compared to just five or six 20 years ago, he noted.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Youth centres have become active in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention and many schools have programs to help students cope with the aftermath of a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 2008, 1,103 people took their own lives in Quebec, compared to 1,620 in 1999, according to the study on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from 1981 to 2008 by the Institut national de sant\'e9 publique du Qu\'e9bec.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 While the drop is significant, Quebec still has one of the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in the world, with 14.2 deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Men account for more than three-quarters of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was the cause of two per cent of deaths in Quebec from 2005 to 2007. It represented 3.3 per cent of men's deaths during that period and one per cent of women's deaths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Montreal has the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate of any major Canadian city. In 2008, 199 people died by their own hand in the city.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But the problem is even worse in Quebec's remote regions. The Gasp\'e9 and Magdalen Islands have the dubious distinction of leading the province in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , with 21.3 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000, followed closely by the North Shore, central Quebec and Abitibi regions.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Isolation, lack of job opportunities and reduced access to social services all contribute to the higher \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in rural areas, said association president Julie Campbell.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's easier in Montreal and Quebec City to get to the resources than in the regions," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As to why \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is more prevalent in Quebec than other provinces, Campbell suggested that the national question is a factor. "We are little bit less solid in our identity than people in the other provinces," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We are not a country. We are searching for our identity, our solidity."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 She added that the fact that religion no longer plays a major role in Quebec society has contributed to the loss of a sense of community. Strong social ties and a sense of belonging are key to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Marchand noted that the province's higher \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate could be partly because Quebec keeps track of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  better than other provinces.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Men between age 35 and 49 are at highest risk for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 From 2005 to 2007, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  accounted for 22 per cent of deaths among Quebec males age 15 to 34, 32 per cent of deaths among men from 20 to 34 and 20 per cent among men from 35 to 49.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The figures were revealed as NHS Cornwall and Isles of Scilly launches a new strategy to try and reduce the number of people who die from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Between 60 and 70 people a year take their own lives in Cornwall and Isles of Scilly. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Strategy brings together people and professionals from very different organisations including: mental health practitioners; people who use the mental health service; social care; education; the police; the criminal justice system; housing support and the drug and alcohol team.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This recognises the fact that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and its prevention is a difficult and emotive issue requiring the input of a wide range of independent and public services.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The strategy has six goals:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ?  to reduce the incidence of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in high risk groups eg people who have used the mental health service; people who have self harmed; young men and the over 75s
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ? To promote mental health and wellbeing amongst the population of Cornwall and Scilly
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ? To reduce the availability of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  methods; especially in hospital and custody settings and through identifying and taking preventive action at \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  hot spots
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ? To promote the responsible reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the media

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Training is also seen as a priority and three specialist Applied \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Intervention Skills Training (ASIST) courses have already been held in Cornwall.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ASIST is seen as "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  first aid" and enables community based care workers to recognise the often subtle signs that a person may be considering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and support them through that crisis.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Until now, people working in the community have not necessarily had the sort of training that front line health professionals get yet they may be in contact with people who are considering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Demand for spaces has been high and more training is planned.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Evidence
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Quinn Scobie, a consultant psychiatrist and chair of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Steering Group said: "We have been working to reduce the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Cornwall and Scilly and evidence suggests that rates are falling.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "However, the economic downturn presents us with new challenges as worries about money and job security are running high."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A new fact sheet, Feeling the Pinch, which gives details of agencies which can help during stressful times, is set to be released in Cornwall tomorrow.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 More than five times as many Canadians took their own lives in 2005 as were killed by others.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Though \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  claims more lives than homicide in Canada every year, newspapers seldom report on the deaths of those who kill themselves. Death by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a story that generally remains hidden in the darkness of our private grief unless it involves a public figure, occurs in a public place or involves murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For many years, the Star's policy on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has been to not tell you that a death was a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  unless there is some overriding public interest in doing so. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That policy is now under review, as part of an overall look at our ethics policies, with some making a case that the media should bring \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  out of the shadows more often to create greater understanding of its tragic toll and perhaps, destigmatize it.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That may be so in some cases, though I have grave concerns that more \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reports would lead to intruding on the privacy of grieving families.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Far more important than the question of whether we should report more on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the critical matter of how we write about it when we do. Journalists must always exercise great caution in covering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , understanding that it's caused by the complex interaction of many factors that most always include mental illness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 We also need to take responsibility for the reality that the way we portray \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  could influence copycat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , what social scientists call "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  contagion." Numerous studies have concluded that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  increase with media reports of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 No less an authority than the World Health Organization weighed in on this in 2003 when it issued media guidelines for reporting on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The WHO tells us that stories about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  should take great care not to sensationalize \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or romanticize those who kill themselves. We should not portray \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as a noble deed or as an understandable response to life's inevitable heartbreak.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As well, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reports must not seek to provide simplistic explanations for why someone took their own life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The WHO also advises against publishing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  notes or specifying details of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  method used. That means that in writing about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , we sometimes might have to downplay the dramatic elements that can make for effective storytelling in other news reports.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Star's front-page story last week of the murder-\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of Sarah Grupstein, 84, who had diabetes and heart disease, and her son Percy Stein, 66, who suffered from terminal cancer and shot his mother before killing himself, raised alarms for reader Peter Hall, a clinical psychologist and University of Waterloo professor.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hall, who emailed us to warn of the risk of "the contagion effect" of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reports, said he didn't think our coverage crossed the line of responsible reporting, but "it did come close."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 I agree with that assessment, but I think that this sad story about the desperate pain of a terminally ill man and his ailing mother is one that needed to be told. And much thought went into our coverage; though we reported on the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  note left by Stein, reporter Tracy Huffman took great care not to include many troubling details from that note.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A commendable second-day story provided necessary context to this tragedy in addressing the issue of community services for seniors who are ill and alone.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Star City Editor Lynn McAuley is well aware that we must hold ourselves to a high standard when writing about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We understand the enormous responsibility we have in covering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and are selective and sensitive to each and every incident," she said. "It is never our intention to sensationalize, glorify or romanticize \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and, for the most part, we hold true to that rule."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 McAuley, quite rightly, also favours more coverage that focuses on prevention of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , both in communicating how to identify individuals at risk and in looking for systemic problems that can allow those at risk to go unnoticed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Whether we report on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  more often is a matter of ongoing debate and I'd be interested in learning your views on that. What's not debatable is that responsible coverage of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  demands caution, context and compassion, as well as deep understanding that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is never just another story, but the end of a troubled life in the most tragic way possible.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A new media-monitoring programme aimed at promoting responsible and accurate coverage of mental health and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was launched yesterday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Headline, which has been established by the Health Service Executive (HSE), is a website which contains information on mental health and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , along with reporting guidelines agreed by the National Union of Journalists and health authorities. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It also plans to highlight examples of positive and negative coverage of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the media, while the public will be able to comment on media coverage of issues relating to mental health.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The guidelines on the website encourage journalists to avoid going into technical detail over the methods used by a person to take their own life; listing details or further sources of information and advice when covering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; not romanticising or glorifying \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; and avoiding simplistic explanations for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They also suggest avoiding phrases such as a "successful" \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt or the use of terms such as "to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " and "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victim". Instead, they encourage the use of phrases such as "a completed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " or to "die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 International research suggests that while the media can play a powerful role in informing the public about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , some types of portrayal can act as a catalyst to influence the behaviour of people at risk.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For example, in the week following an episode of Casualty on BBC - which included a storyline about a paracetamol overdose - rates of self-poisoning in the UK increased by 175 per cent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On the other hand, studies show that positive portrayal of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the media can have striking results.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For example, a study following the death of Nirvana lead singer Kurt Cobain found there was no overall increase in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in his hometown of Seattle, largely as a result of a close collaboration between media and authorities to ensure appropriate reporting took place.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Headline will be managed by Schizophrenia Ireland and represents the interests of seven mental health-related voluntary organisations including Aware, the eating disorders association Bodywhys, the mental health group Grow, the Irish Advocacy Network, Mental Health Ireland and the Samaritans.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Figures released by The Samaritans, which supports people in crisis, and Relate, the charity which offers relationship counselling, show:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Nearly three quarters of attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - 74 per cent - are because of relationship problems.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  n In the past, women made up the majority of attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases where relationship difficulties were cited as a major factor. But now 50 per cent of men who attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  report difficulties with their partner.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  n Most people who attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are single, and people who are divorced or separated are more likely to attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than people in stable relationships.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  n Around one in 100 people who unsuccessfully try to kill themselves will die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  within a year of the attempt.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  n The group at highest risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is young women aged between 15 and 19 years old.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  n \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts by young men aged 15 to 24 have nearly tripled, rising by 194 per cent since the mid 1980s.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  n The majority of people attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  68 per cent are under 35 years old.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  n There are two \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a day among young people and a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every 70 minutes across the whole of the UK.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  n \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  accounts for 20 per cent of deaths in the 15 to 24 years age group compared to one per cent across the whole UK population.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Hemlock Society is dedicated to the view that there are at least    two forms of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  One is emotional \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  (or irrational    self-murder) in all its complexities. Let me emphasize that the Hemlock    Society view on that form of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is to prevent it where you can. We    do not encourage \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for reasons of poor mental health or    unhappiness. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      We say that there is a second form of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide:\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  justifiable \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  That is, rational and planned self-deliverance; put another way, this    is auto-euthanasia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      What the Hemlock Society and its supporters are talking about is    auto-euthanasia. But we also have to face up to the fact it is called    \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by law. (\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is not a crime in the English-speaking world,    neither is attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but assistance in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for any reason    remains a crime. Even if the helper is acting from the best motives, it    remains a crime in the Anglo-American world.)        \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for the following reasons can be justified ethically by the    average Hemlock Society supporter:         Advanced terminal illness that is causing unbearable suffering to    the individual. This is the most common reason for self-deliverance.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       Grave physical handicap, which is so restricting that the    individual cannot, even after due consideration and training, tolerate    such a limited existence. This is fairly rare as a reason for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      What are the ethical parameters for auto-euthanasia? The person    should:         Be a mature adult.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       Have clearly made a considered decision.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       Have already sought medical help.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       Inform the treating physician and take his response into account.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       Have made a will disposing of his worldly effects.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       Plan the exit from this life without involving others in criminal    liability.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0       Leave a note saying exactly why he or she is self-destructing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      Having considered the logic in favor of auto-euthanasia, the person    should also address the countervailing arguments:        Should the person go into a hospice? Put bluntly, hospices make the    best of a bad job, and they do so with great skill and love. The    euthanasia movement supports their work. Not everyone wants that form    of treatment, and hospice care cannot make dying into a beautiful    experience although it tries hard to do so. A hospice really means    appropriate medicine and care, which everybody deserves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      Another consideration is the question: Does suffering ennoble? Is    suffering a part of life and a preparation for death? Our response here    is that if that is your firm belief, then you are not a candidate for    voluntary euthanasia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      Another consideration is whether, by checking out before the Grim    Reaper calls, you are depriving yourself of a valuable period of life    and also depriving your family and friends of your love and    companionship? Practitioners of active voluntary euthanasia almost    always wait until a late stage in the dying process; some even wait too    long and go into a coma and are frustrated in self-deliverance.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      From my years in the Hemlock Society, hearing the feedback of    hundreds, maybe thousands, of cases, I can assure you that most    believers in euthanasia do enjoy life, love living, and their feeling    of the sanctity of life is as strong as anybody's.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0      Yet they are willing, if their dying is distressing to them, to    forgo a few weeks of the end and leave under their own control.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 BURIED among Tokyo's latest government statistics is an alarming suggestion that increasing numbers of Japanese may be setting fire to themselves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  According to the National Fire Defence Board, 1986 saw a 22.2 per cent increase in the number of people committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with fire.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Listed under "Deaths by Fire" were 804 victims last year compared with 658 in 1985.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Are Japanese setting fire to themselves like the self-immolating Buddhist monks of the Vietnam war era? There was one notable incident last November in which seven women doused themselves in kerosene and burned themselves after their sect "guru" died. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  But the new fire board statistics do not indicate a rise in self-immolation. Rather, a general rise in the number of Japanese \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and a cultural quirk about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "with" fire instead of "by" fire.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with fire - when a person kills themselves by any method after setting fire to their home or valuables - is also related to the most tragic form of Japanese \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , that in which a person first kills his or her young children.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The killing of young before \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a horrifying but age-old Japanese practice. It is widely believed that, in a society which emphasises the family unit and has little sense of community welfare services, surviving children would face miserable lives without their parents.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Hence, a mother killing herself in protest at her husband's adultery might first kill the kids.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  This is recognised by Japanese courts to the extent that the mother who first killed her children would not be charged with murder.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The whole act is seen as a failed joint \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and even American courts have used this cultural interpretation when dealing with such Japanese family tragedies in the United States.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Multiple \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are relatively common in Japan, where 490 of last year's 25,524 listed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were classified as group \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Those figures do not include the child victims of family \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and unwilling adult partners in multiple \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Japanese language has terms for all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The "shinju" or group-double \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  include: "boshi shinju" involving a mother and children, "oyako shinju" when both parents \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and take some of their children, and "ikka shinju" or \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of the whole family."Shudan jisatsu" are group \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  other than a family.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  According to Professor Kenji Tamura, of Toyo University's sociology department, the important thing is to distinguish the difference between "shoshin jisatsu" or self-immolation, and "hoka jisatsu" which means \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  "with" fire.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Immolation as a means of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is not that popular in Japan, he says.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Hanging is most popular and jumping is also very big. In recent years city people have also been using drugs and gas.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "These latter methods could be a sign of people who are not fully committed to the idea of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and who hope to be found before they die." Guns are not used in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as often as in Australia, largely because Japan's tougher gun laws make them harder to come by.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The big cultural cliche of Japanese seppuku or harakiri, ritual disembowelment is almost non-existent.In feudal days, samurai men were trained to take this honorable but extremely uncomfortable path to the next world if necesary, while women were more likely to cut their own throats.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Since World War 2, there have been only two or three cases of seppuku, with the most recent the 1970 and 1975 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of two extremist authors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The kamikaze pilots of the Pacific war also helped to embed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  into foreign stereotypes of Japanese behavior.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Japanese \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates are high compared to Australia's, but certainly not the highest in the world.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Japan's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in 1986 was 21 out of 100,000 people, compared with 11 in Australia (1984 figures), 12.1 in the US, 0.2 in Egypt and 44.9 in Hungary (all 1980 figures).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Prof. Tamura argues that the Japanese \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  practices of killing young children and using fire both result from the Japanese sense of self or identity.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "Japanese people identify very strongly with the home and children, which form an unusually central part of the Japanese self-image," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Japanese home is extremely private, akin to a Westerner's bedroom.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  FRIENDS are rarely invited into a Japanese home, partly as a result of simple logistics - most Japanese have tiny homes - and partly because of the very personal view of the home.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  The Japanese have one word "jibun" to mean one's self and another "bunshin" to cover "one's other self", which can equally mean one's home or one's children.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "So when people want to destroy themselves they might also kill their children or destroy their home," Prof. Tamura said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  "There is also a general Japanese belief in an after-life and fire is a traditional tool of purification."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Is the media contributing to Caltrain \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After a recent spate of people taking their lives in front of speeding trains on Caltrain tracks, one prominent rail safety official said he is convinced that newspaper and TV coverage is spurring copycat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The media's job is to report, no question about it," said Art Lloyd, president of the state chapter of Operation Lifesaver and a member of Caltrain's board of directors. "But part of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  problem is people looking in the newspaper and thinking 'This is a good way to take my life.'" 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The link between media coverage and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a thorny question with no clear-cut answer, but one Caltrain officials have often grappled with as they seek to stop \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that have claimed the lives of 118 people since 1992.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lloyd calls the phenomenon the "Golden Gate Syndrome," after heavy media coverage of jumpers from the Golden Gate Bridge, he believes, drew other people to take their lives in the same way.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lloyd said he would not tell the media how to cover Caltrain \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but said press accounts of deaths are often too sensational. Many other Caltrain officials don't see a link between media coverage and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "[\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims] are already in a certain state of mind," said Mike Nevin, a County Supervisor and a Caltrain board member. "I don't see how what's printed in the newspaper really affects that."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But at least one study shows coverage of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by a prominent newspaper or television news may have the effect of increasing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among readers or viewers, especially when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  stories are frequent and prominently played.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 1994, an Austrian research team found \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in front of the Vienna subway dropped by 80 percent in the six months after reporters began covering the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  less extensively and dramatically.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The total number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Vienna also dropped as well.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Local newspapers defended their coverage of Caltrain \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Caltrain is a form of public transportation that people take, so they need to know about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," said Jamie Casini, mid-County editor for The Independent. "I just feel that a person that is going to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is very depressed ... they are going to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  anyway regardless of newspaper coverage."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Eve Meyer, executive director of the San Francisco \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention, said there are steps newspapers can take steps to present a balanced picture of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Stories should be written matter-of-factly," Meyer said. "They should also not make the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  seem inevitable, mysterious or magnetic in any way."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Caltrain officials said they would never ask the media to stop covering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , even though since the 1980s most media outlets have curtailed their coverage of people jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's not an apple to apple comparison," said Rita Haskin, chief communications officer for Caltrain. "When someone commits \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in front of Caltrain, it affects hundreds of riders and can close streets. A Caltrain \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has an impact beyond someone just jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Caltrain officials have undertaken a vigorous campaign to curb images of unsafe use of the rails in the media. Caltrain officials wrote to Macy's a few years ago when the department store ran a clothing add featuring people walking on train tracks.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They have also written letters to The Times and San Francisco Chronicle, when similar pictures have appeared in those newspapers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In recent years, Caltrain officials have taken a number of steps to curb \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , including fencing in sections of track and posting hundreds of signs that have \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention hotline phone numbers along the rails and in stations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 So far, there have been six deaths on the rails this year, including five \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The County Coroner has not made a ruling on the sixth death.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 WASHINGTON Gun control advocates talk about "the gun show loophole" and "child safety locks." People who support owning firearms talk about "our constitutional rights" and "self-defense." But one word is rarely mentioned in the gun debate: \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This, despite the fact that more people in the United States die from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than homicides, and most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are committed with a
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 gun. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When groups pushing for gun control quote numbers for "violent gun deaths," they include \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , which often account for more than half of the total.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When the National League of Cities erected a "Wall of Gun Deaths" at the Million Mom March this month, 658 of the names on it were \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "If you have a gun in the home, the risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is five times higher," said Kimberly Mariani, a spokeswoman for Handgun Control Inc., the leading gun control advocacy organization.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The group says reducing the number of guns will help reduce \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . They cite studies showing that many \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are the result of impulsive behavior and that the increased rate of youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  over the past four decades is largely related to the use of guns.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate for people 15 to 19 years old increased 11 percent from 1980 to 1997, and most of that increase is due to gun \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 1997, 1,135 teens in that
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 age group committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with a gun.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Over all age groups, guns were involved in 17,566 of the 30,535 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that year, the CDC reported.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The National Rifle Association denies that guns are responsible for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The group says firearms are "merely implements utilized to accomplish the act, implements for which others would be substituted if firearms were not available."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The NRA also contends that availability of guns in a city or country does not translate into a high rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A cause-and-effect relationship between guns and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates is hard to establish.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For example, in the District of Columbia, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is lower than in any state, while the gun homicide rate is high.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The low \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is likely a consequence of the racial makeup of the district, which is mostly black. In 1997, white males accounted for 72 percent of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and whites as a group accounted for 90 percent, according to the CDC.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 International comparisons are of little help, because reporting methods vary among countries, as do cultural and religious attitudes toward \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to a recent report from the World Health Organization, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in Israel is low 8.2 per 100,000 in 1996 compared with a U.S. rate of 19.3 even though many households have guns because of compulsory military duty for men and women.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But in the United Kingdom, where gun control laws are strict, the 1997 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is also lower than in the United States, 11 per 100,000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Many counselors and doctors strongly support gun control as a method of reducing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Alan Berman, executive director of the American Association of Suicidology, said that the probability of death in a gun \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt is 92 percent, much higher than with other methods.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Unfortunately, it's lethal in a moment of despair," he said. "It doesn't give the person a chance to change their mind."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Firearm safety is one of the goals of the Washington-based nonprofit association that promotes research and public education about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and training for crisis volunteers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Berman advocates several gun control proposals, including child trigger locks, part of a juvenile crime package that is stuck in Congress.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Senate last year passed a crime bill that would require the locks, require buyers at gun shows to undergo background checks, and ban importing large-capacity ammunition clips. The bill would also prohibit juveniles with serious criminal records from possessing guns for life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A similar House bill did not include the gun provisions, and a compromise between the two versions has eluded negotiators, with the gun show language being the biggest sticking point.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dhaka, Sept. 12 -- The World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, which is held on the 10th of September and is recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO), is organized by the International Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention (IASP).The World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day this year also marks the release of the World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Report (WSR) by the WHO. The report describes the current situation of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and suggests steps to prevent them.The theme for this year's World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day is '\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention: One World Connected.'  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This theme brings about the importance of remaining connected with individuals who may be vulnerable to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Some important steps that can be taken at different levels in accordance with this theme are:o As an individual, you can stay connected with those who are socially isolated. If you just extend a hand of friendship, you may be actually saving a life. After all, everybody wants to be loved! We often feel that we don't have enough time for ourselves, and therefore cannot spare time for others. Just try out spending a few minutes a day with someone who needs company, and you will find that it makes you much happier as well.o If someone even jokingly suggests \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , make sure that you connect the person with a counsellor. You may never know how serious the statement is!o As mentioned above, people with mental health problems like depression may be unable to take steps to prevent themselves from committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . It is therefore necessary that they are connected with the right doctors and are treated correctly. Unfortunately, treatment for mental health problems is still beyond the reach of a large population of the world.o It is also important that organizations working toward \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention should coordinate their activities so that the final impact on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention is much more than the individual effects. It has also been suggested that inputs from relatives of individuals who have committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  could also be useful.A recent news report labelled India as the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  capital of the world, with 2.8 lakh cases in the year 2012. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a major cause of deaths in the young, productive population of the world. To worsen the issue, the number of people who attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is far more than the ones who succeed.Why would a person want to take his/her life while most of us cling on to it? Among the important causes for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  especially in the Western World are mental health problems like depression and alcoholism-related conditions. Individuals suffering from these conditions are vulnerable to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and may not be able to reason out with themselves. In India, family problems and illnesses have been listed as the most common causes of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 2012. Thus, it is necessary to reach out to such individuals and treat them before it is too late.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ISLAMABAD, Sept. 11 -- The Institute of Psychiatry and WHO Collaborating Centre at Benazir Bhutto Hospital will organise an awareness seminar at the BBH today (Wednesday) in connection with World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, which is being observed around the globe on September 10.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The day brings together individuals and organisations with an interest in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention and mobilises efforts to save the lives lost to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . In 2014, the theme of World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day is '\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention: One World Connected', which reflects the need for cooperation among countries at several levels to combat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said the Institute of Psychiatry and WHO collaborating Centre at the BBH have planned to highlight issues related to the phenomenon of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in a seminar titled 'Awareness Session for World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day'.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said two of the most eminent mental health professionals of the country, Professor Malik H Mubashar (former vice chancellor of the University of Health Sciences and ex-principal of the Rawalpindi Medical College) and Professor Mowadat Hussain Rana (dean of psychiatry, College of Physicians and Surgeons) will speak on the occasion.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said the session will highlight social, psychological and cultural factors that can lead a person to suicidal behaviour. The seminar will help raise awareness about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as public health issue and emphasise on the need for the policy-makers and the government to give it the utmost priority.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To a query, Dr. Minhas said the issue has emerged as a great problem during last few years around the globe. The World Health Organisation published its first global report on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  this year titled 'Preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 : A Global Imperative' that presents a comprehensive overview of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention efforts worldwide, he added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said the report identifies evidence-based approaches to policymaking and programme development on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention that can be adapted to different settings. The report also provides a global knowledge based on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts as well as actionable steps for countries based on their current resources and context to move forward in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Giving details, Dr. Minhas said the figures presented in the report paint an alarming picture. There are 1.5 million violent deaths every year in the world, of which 800,000 are \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . This means that one person commits \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every 40 seconds. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is responsible for more deaths than wars, conflicts and natural catastrophes, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Talking of the trend, he said men are almost twice as likely as women to take their own lives. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates are highest in people over the age of 70 but in some countries, the highest rates are found among the young and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is now the second leading cause of death among 15-29 year-old persons. The report dispels the general misconception that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a problem mostly found in rich countries as, in fact, 75 per cent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occur in low and middle-income countries, said Professor Minhas.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said the statistics from Pakistan tell a similar story. As many as 13,377 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the year 2012. Among these 7,085 were males while 6,291 were females. The highest rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were seen in the elderly followed by young adults like the global trend.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He added a national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategy is required to systematically deal with this issue. "A range of prevention strategies such as surveillance, means restriction, media guidelines, stigma reduction, raising of public awareness as well as training for health workers need to be employed." To a query, Professor Minhas said the risk factors associated with the health system and society at large include difficulties in accessing health care, easy availability of the means for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , inappropriate media reporting that sensationalizes \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and stigma against people who seek help for suicidal behaviours, or for mental health and substance abuse problems.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said the WHO report says that one strategy that can reduce \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is to enact policies that restrict people's access to the most common methods of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The other important initiative should be to make health care and social care systems much more responsive to people who are at high risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , said Dr. Minhas

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The death of actor Robin Williams is a stark reminder that neither wealth nor fame is sufficient to deter people from killing themselves. Williams's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has also highlighted the issue of depression, not just among famous people, but also among ordinary folk.  
\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 World Health Organisation estimates indicate that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is common in both rich and poor countries. Every year, some 800,000 people around the world kill themselves. Greenland had the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in 2011 (83 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 people), followed by Lithuania, South Korea, Guyana and Kazakhstan. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Caribbean countries such as Haiti tend to have fewer \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , while Asian and northern and eastern European countries tend to have higher rates. In 1995, more young people died of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the US than of cancer, stroke, pneumonia and heart disease combined.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Statistics on Kenya are hard to come by, but evidence suggests that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are on the rise, particularly among youth. Globally, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is among the top three causes of death among youth aged between 15 and 44. Generally, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates among males are higher than among females.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Researchers say that rising \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates and cases of depression, particularly among youth, could be attributed to a variety of factors, including the breakdown of the traditional family, and the resulting loneliness and alienation aggravated by modern lifestyles and technological advances that have reduced the need for personal social contact. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 However, not all people who are severely depressed commit or contemplate \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; nor are those who commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  depressed. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 RATIONAL REASONS 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Author Andrew Solomon, who dissects depression and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in his book, The Noonday Demon, and who has suffered from depression for several years, says that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is sometimes prompted by a sudden painful external event, such as the loss of a loved one. Other people kill themselves because of what they believe are totally "rational" reasons, such as when a terminal or debilitating illness strikes and when the prospect of living is more daunting than that of dying.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Some people are more prone to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than others. Personality, genetics, childhood experiences and substance abuse seem to play a role in determining who will kill him or herself and who will not.  A link between alcoholism and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has also been made. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Highly successful and talented people also seem prone to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , says Solomon, because they tend to set very high standards for themselves and are often disappointed even in their greatest achievements.  Excessive self-examination among artists and other creative people may lead to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Writers and poets are particularly vulnerable, as are highly successful businessmen, scientists and composers.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 In Kenya, not much attention is paid to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and depression, partly because of the stigma attached to them, and also because both are considered afflictions of the rich. In a country where people are dying from preventable diseases such as malaria and Aids, it may seem specious to focus on mental illnesses. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 However, in a country where there are very few psychologists and psychiatrists and limited options for affordable counselling, it is possible that we are looking at a public health crisis that we are not even aware of. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 The rising incidence of people taking their own lives and the lives of their family members may be an indicator that the mental health of the nation is in a precarious state.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 * * * 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 The police killing of the African-American teenager Michael Brown, and the subsequent anti-racism riots in the United States, has brought home the fact that racism there has not been suppressed even under a black President.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 However, what do you call the racism of blacks against fellow blacks? At the Coast, I have often witnessed Kenyan women married to white men adopting the worst racist attitudes towards fellow Kenyans. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0 Women who grew up in poverty look down on their poverty-stricken brethren and often treat them with contempt. It is a case of the oppressed adopting the attitudes of the oppressor, which ultimately is a victory for the oppressor. Franz Fanon's Black Skins, White Masks should be required reading in our schools.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 NEW DELHI: As many as 15 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  took place every hour during 2013 in India with \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  due to illegitimate pregnancies showing a sharp rise of 64.5%. The latest data from National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) for 2013 show that more than one lakh people (1,34,799) took their lives for various reasons ranging from family problems to illness during the year. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the data, Tamil Nadu (12.3%), Maharashtra (12.3%), Andhra Pradesh (10.8%), West Bengal (9.7%) and Karnataka (8.4%) together contributed 53.5% of total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims. 'Family problems' (24.0%) and 'Illness' (19.6%) continue to be the greatest killers accounting for 43.6% of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , according to the data.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It also seems to suggest senior citizens are most depressed in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh where 54.9% of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims were in the age group 60 years and above. Nearly 70.8% of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims were married men while 66.6% were married women. Students constituted 6.2% of the total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims while one in every six victims was a housewife.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That financial problems are big reason for people committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is reflected in the fact that 38.0% of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims were 'self-employed' while only 7.2% were 'un-employed'.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hanging continues to be the preferred way to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with 39.8% of all victims dying by 'hanging' as against 27.9% consuming poison and 7.4% self-immolating.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If data for past three years is taken into account, hanging seems to be growing in popularity while poison is declining. The data shows during last three years hanging claimed 33.2% of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims in 2011, 37% in 2012 and 39.8% in 2013. Poisoning on the other hand claimed 32% victims in 2011, 29.1% in 2012 and 27.9% in 2013. Among 53 mega cities, Bengaluru (2,033), Chennai (2,450), Delhi (1,753) and Mumbai (1,322) together have reported almost 35.5% of the total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reported from mega 53 cities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The pattern of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reported from 53 cities showed that 'hanging' (58.4%), 'poisoning' (15.0%) and 'fire/self-immolation' (9.5%) were the prominent means adopted by the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims in the cities. The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in cities (13.3) was higher as compared to all-India \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate (11.0).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Can \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ever be a rational choice?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 More than two-thirds of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are driven by a mentally disordered mind, experts say. But a provocative new article published this week in the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry asks can \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ever be rational - a decision made under free will, in the absence of any diagnosable mental illness and with full appreciation for the potential consequences? 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Designating \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as an undesirable event that should never occur raises the debate of who is responsible for one's life and runs the risk of erroneously attributing blame for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," University of Toronto psychiatry resident Angela Ho writes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In cases where people are of full mind and mental capacity, "there is much debate about whether \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can ever be rational," Dr. Ho writes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Society's "overarching desire" is to prevent death by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But the view that death is "the greatest of harms" potentially overlooks the possibility that intolerable psychological suffering may be equally harmful, she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 No one can predict with any certainty someone will commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Dr. Ho said. Still, the responsibility for preventing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  tends to fall on the treating doctor, she said. Patient \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are among the most frequent malpractice claims against psychiatrists.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Physicians are often expected to predict and prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and then if it occurs, they may be blamed," Dr. Ho said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But that attitude ignores the complexity of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Most guidelines for managing people with suicidal thoughts are based on the premise that depression, substance abuse or other forms of mental illness drive \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Little is said about the concept of rational \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - managing cases of suicidal thinking in people who are mentally stable, and who therefore should be able to make rational decisions, Dr. Ho writes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "People may have difficulties coping with life," Dr. Ho said in an interview. "Maybe they don't have a lot of support or healthy ways of dealing with their emotions. Sometimes people feel overwhelmed and feel like \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the only answer."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Clearer guidance for doctors is needed on how best to approach these cases, she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It's an issue that raises tension between individual rights and a doctor's human instincts and ethical duty to protect life, she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 That tension is being played out in the euthanasia debate.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr. Ho said there is growing interest whether unbearable suffering from psychological pain may be the same as suffering associated with terminal illness.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts among students are something all high schools deal with, says the principal of an Ottawa school that will be part of a pilot project to train teachers, students and parents in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There are always attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at every school," said France Thibault, principal of Glebe Collegiate Institute, one of two high schools taking part in the program. "We feel very blessed with the supports that we have that we can say in spite of the number of attempts ... the numbers (of youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ) are limited across the city."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Schools are increasingly becoming key to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, something the program announced Friday will address. Funded with a $183,000 grant from the Trillium Foundation, the program will support \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention education and training programs for staff, students and parents at Glebe Collegiate and West Carleton Secondary School.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "You can't have too much training," said Thibault. "We live in a world where young people suffer from a great deal of anxiety. Their parents are highly concerned, their teachers are very concerned. We all want to know that we can do the most for those children."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The program is a response to growing concern about youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in light of the high-profile \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  of Ottawa teenagers Daron Richardson and Jamie Hubley in recent years. It was announced as part of the release Friday of the Community \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Network's 2013 report to the community.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention network was formed as a response to heightened awareness and concern about youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and mental health issues. It brings together key community organizations to develop \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention and intervention strategies.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  represent 10 per cent of about 60 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Ottawa every year, suicidal thoughts, anxiety and mental health concerns among youth are skyrocketing. According to the Champlain LHIN, about 9,200 youth in the region had suicidal thoughts in the past 12 months. And the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario is seeing unprecedented demand for mental health services.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The more we bring programs such as this one into our schools, the more we de-stigmatize the issues or concerns so people don't have to feel that they are alone," said Reg Lavergne, principal at West Carleton.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The training, he said, insures there are many eyes watching students.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lavergne said he recently told his students to remember that they are not alone, adding. "When you see someone who might feel alone, or who might be entering into crisis, you need to reach out. It's not that we have all the answers, but we need to find the people that can help."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Enabling schools to have a greater capacity to support suicidal youth "should be a top priority in all our communities," said Sandra Lalonde of the Ontario Trillium Foundation.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This will not only address this issue, but it will change the social norms around help-seeking behaviour that often discourages youth from speaking out."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a global issue and leading cause of death in the world claiming live of around one million people every year in the world, eminent psychiatric of Sir Cowasji Jehangir Institute of Psychiatry (S.C.J) Hyderabad Dr. Darya Khan Laghari informed this while talking to reporter that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a multi-dimensional disorder which results from a complex interaction of biological, genetic, psychological and environmental factors, said here on Thursday. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a country like Pakistan where growing economic instability especially poverty has forced people to sell their children and body organs, he said that the reasons behind increasing rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  can be understandable.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr. Darya Khan Laghari, said that some psychology experts also agreed with the fact that majority of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are usually linked to economic difficulties but there are other reasons also behind \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and these reasons can be depressive disorders, unemployment, domestic violence, parental separation, growing economic instability, child abuse, bullying, rising inflation and loss of social cohesion which force a person to end his or her life or release them from the pain they are suffering from.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In recent years, the psychiatric said that Pakistan has witnessed a drastic increase in the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but the basic thing is that no national data on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is avaiable.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said that the surveys and analysis revealed that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate has become more common in youth then in adult in many countries and Pakistan is one of them. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates among youth are increasing due to unemployment, pressure of work and studies, depression, anxiety and increasing poverty, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr. Darya Khan informed that there were no official statistics for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Pakistan; however, there are compelling evidence that the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ratio has gradually been increasing in Pakistan over the last few years; he said and added that the upward trend has been very dramatic with almost 3,000 cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  being reported in 2009. Even this is considered to be an underestimation, as it is well known that in many developing countries \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  tends to be grossly under-reported, he added.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and depression are linked to each other as more than 80 percent of people who commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  suffered from depression. He said studies suggest that lifetime risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in people with depression was 15 percent, with alcoholism 7-15 percent and with schizophrenia, 4-10 percent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However, a substantial proportion of people who commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  die without having seen a mental health professional, he said and added that detection, and referral and management of psychiatric disorders in primary care was an important step in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Despite the morbid nature of the subject, Dr Murad Moosa Khan's talk on 'The Enigma of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide'\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  drew a surprisingly large and diverse audience at T2F on Wednesday.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Khan, trained as a psychiatrist at Kings College, London, started off the talk by telling the story of a 12-year-old boy who committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Abbottabad on May 29, 2012. The boy left a note telling his mother that he hated his school's hostel and advised her to not send his siblings there. Dr Khan stressed that this case was important because \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is highly unusual among 12 year olds. Dr Khan felt that the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  could have been prevented if programmes providing psychological counselling had been in place at the school.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The word \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has its roots in the Latin word, 'suicidum', with 'sui' standing for oneself and cidium for 'killing'," said Dr Khan, adding that the act was something extremely personal. "It is not a disease," he clarified. He said a number of factors have to come together at a particular point in a person's life to set him or her on a suicidal path way. "A number of eminent intellectuals, including artist Van Gogh, novelists Virginia Woolf and Earnest Hemingway, actress Marilyn Munroe and singer Kurt Cobain, committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ." 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  through the ages
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have happened throughout history and the act crosses national, provincial and ethnic boundaries," said Dr Khan. He went on to speak how perceptions about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have evolved over the years. "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was banned in Roman times and Christianity severely condemned it," he said, adding that the attitudes towards \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  began to change in the Middle Ages. He pointed out that it was only in recent times that societies had matured enough to realise that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was a multi-faceted problem influenced by numerous social and cultural factors.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A range of perspectives
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Khan pointed out that evolutionary psychology also explores how an organism develops the ability to harm itself. "The philosophical perspective states that people become more inclined towards \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  when they began to question the 'why' of their existence." He then quoted eminent psychologist Thomas Joiner who hypothesised that people develop suicidal tendencies when they begin to feel they are a burden on others.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Khan stressed that in addition to feeling like a burden, a person must also have a sense of fearlessness. "He must be brave enough and believe that he can kill himself." He also mentioned that the 'public health perspective' on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had become increasingly important in recent years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Types of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Rational \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , mass \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bombing and cultural \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are among some of the types." Dr Khan explained that 'rational \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide'\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was a form of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in which a person, who doesn't suffer from any illness or suffering, decides to end his life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He added that 'suttee' a form of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in which a woman stepped on the funeral pyre after her husband's death was an outlawed form of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  which continues to be practiced in parts of India.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  across national, religious boundaries
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "About one million people take their own lives each year," said Dr Khan. He added that the figure translated into 90 deaths per hour.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He pointed out that Russia and the Central Asian states had the highest rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . "Pakistan is, unfortunately, included in the countries that do not collect data on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Khan also mentioned that Muslims had the lowest rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among religions. "Islam has a deterrent effect on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," he said, adding that atheists world over had the highest rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . "So it is good to believe in God, no matter which one you wish to believe in."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He also pointed out that the ratio of male to female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims is 3:1. "More women attempt to kill themselves than men. But men are more successful in taking their own lives."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He pointed out that women were more resilient and had a stronger support system of friends of family than men. "Statistics reveal that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates are highest in the upper-most and lowest classes," said Dr Khan, adding that if anyone attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  once, they were 10 to 20 per cent more likely to try it again.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He also showed a newspaper clipping which stated that the cost of a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  bomber in Pakistan was between $6,000 and $30,000.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 FOUNDER member of Charleville \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Awareness Project Margaret O'Callaghan has added her voice to those looking for the retention of Ballyhoura Development Ltd to deliver development supports to local communities. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ms O'Callaghan, whose son died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 1996, has campaigned to raise the issue of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  within the local community and was prominent in the setting up of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Awareness Project in Charleville, for which she acknowledges the great help she got from the local office of Ballyhoura Development Ltd.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I met the Development Officer David O'Grady and he agreed to help me and this led to the formation of Charleville \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Awareness Project in 2008, the aim of which was to develop and implement a community approach to address the issue of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the Charleville community. It would also act as a resource to raise awareness of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and develop initiatives to support \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, intervention and postvention in partnership with local communities and support agencies," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Ballyhoura Development Ltd has done a lot for Charleville \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Awareness Project, such as arranging for the Safe Talk courses which attracted 450 people, while another 350 people have completed the Assist course and a peer support training course has also been completed," said Ms O'Callaghan.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The members of Charleville \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Awareness Project will release 200 white balloons and 50 Chinese lanterns on 10th September, which is National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Awareness Day, in memory of those who have died by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . They have also produced wallet-sized cards containing a list of emergency numbers and A4 cards for display in premises.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Ms O'Callaghan emphasises that they would not have those services in place were it not for the support of Ballyhoura Development Ltd. "Charleville needs the services of Ballyhoura Development Ltd. It is a small town with not a lot of services for people, especially the youth of the community, and Ballyhoura does a lot for us and it would be a shame to see this service go. I am extremely worried what the affect of losing such a service would do to our community," she said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 THE HEAD OF an Irish \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention agency claims the Government has  worse than failed  when it comes to tackling mental health and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  issues.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although Taoiseach Enda Kenny has promised to make mental health and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention a priority, little has been done to address the issue, according to the chairman of Turn the Tide of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Noel Smyth. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  They have worse than failed when it comes to dealing with mental health. They have totally reneged on their promise. We have met with all the relevant ministers over the years. Going away and doing nothing seems to be part of their course,  he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  They talk to you, wring their hands and say everything they will do. Then they do nothing.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  They absolutely have to take notice and deliver the message they promised. The reality is that if we do not change our ways, we will lose more young people. We can t just treat this like just another problem. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Smyth said that one of the only ways to tackle \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  would be the development of a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention authority, much like the Road Safety Authority, as three times more people die from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than on Irish roads.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  A dedicated \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Authority with the autonomy to address this issue is the only solution. The aim of our campaign is to highlight just how big the problem of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is in Ireland and to create a groundswell of public support for change,  he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Turn the Tide of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , which receives no Government funding,launched its campaign to boost \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  awareness among young men in Ireland this week. The campaign includes a video of people observing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -related photos across Dublin.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The videos were produced to bring a new sense of awareness to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  figures that may not be known. The campaign includes posters depicting Government reluctance to tackle the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  issue and a petition. So far, reaction to the campaign has been positive.  The campaign is new, but we have received positive feedback so far.

\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Why? This is THE biggest question \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 following a \cf17 suicide\cf .\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is about not being able to cope with the unbearable emotional pain that a person is experiencing, maybe for some time. While it is important to remember that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cuts across all social and professional strata, there are certain  factors which increase the risk, including gender (four times as many men complete \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  but more women attempt), living in a rural area (isolation and access to means), alcohol and drug abuse, bullying, self-harm and imprisonment. There is usually no single cause and therefore no single solution.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If we talk about \cf17 suicide\cf  are we likely to \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 put the thought into their head?\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Research shows that if someone is not thinking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  then we will not put the idea into their head. The positive effect of asking someone if they are thinking of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is that it will open up a channel of communication and give the person permission to talk if they wish. Imagine if someone is about to take the biggest decision of their life, and someone asks them the question  the result is relief.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There seem to be a lot of \cf17 suicides\cf  in young people who \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 have been using social media networking sites  does this contribute to \cf17 suicide\cf ?\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The consequences of bullying online are well documented and can result in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The other worrying factor is that young people build an online shrine to friends who have killed themselves.  They do not make the connection that death is final and some of the comments left on personal pages  such as Miss you, See you soon, Can't wait to see you in heaven  confirm this. Usually, friends leave very moving messages, and for some young people, this may result in them thinking Maybe if I 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 kill myself, all my friends will write nice things about me. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This glamorising of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 can lead to copycat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  or contagion.
\par \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Does self-harm lead to \cf17 suicide\cf ?\b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Self-harm is a factor which can increase your risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The main aim of self-harm is, like \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , to release the unbearable emotional pain. When people self-harm, they can be trying to express complicated or hidden feelings, trying to tell you that they need support, proving to themselves that they are not invisible, feeling in control and feeling that they are alive. Not all people who self-harm are seeking to kill themselves  sometimes \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is an accident. Self-harm is sometimes known as a compromise between life and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and can actually be a protective factor against \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . It is however, a warning sign, that someone

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ISLAMABAD, Feb. 4 -- An association between improvements in mental health services and reduction in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates has been established in a recent study.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Using nine national recommendations for safer services made by the National Confidential Inquiry, researchers compared the rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in NHS Mental Health Trusts before and after the recommendations were adopted. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They compared \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates in Trusts that adopted few of the recommendations with those that adopted many.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The study showed that Trusts that implemented between seven and nine of the key recommendations had lower \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates than those that implemented six or fewer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Recommendations that produced the biggest drop in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates, when implemented, were the introduction of 24-hour crisis teams, policies for drug and alcohol misuse, and multi-disciplinary reviews after a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The study also shows that the growing use of the recommendations is linked to a reduction in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in specific patient groups.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A reduction in in-patient \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was associated with the removal of ligature points in hospitals.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A reduction in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among patients with a history of missed contact with services was associated with assertive outreach services, designed to keep in touch with them after they left hospital.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Trusts that did not implement the recommendations saw little reduction in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The National Confidential Inquiry has been collecting and studying data on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by people in contact with mental health services in the UK since 1997. This study focused on the 12,881 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 91 mental health services in England and Wales between 1997 and 2006. This represents 26% of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in England and Wales during this time.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Nav Kapur, Professor of Psychiatry and Population Health said: "These are really important findings for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  research and mental health services internationally. No other studies have been able to show what impact specific mental health service improvements have on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "For most of the nine recommendations, services that implemented them had a decreased \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate after implementation. The results show that NHS services and mental health professionals are likely to have contributed to the prevention of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the saving of lives."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Professor Louis Appleby, Director of the National Confidential Inquiry, said: "The community care reforms of the last decade seem to have had a positive impact on patient \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - providing more intensive support to the most vulnerable patients appears to have improved their survival."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Peter Byrne, Associate Registrar at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: "We welcome this excellent study showing how local implementation of comprehensive mental health services reduces the number of people who die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . It proves the value of investing in safe psychiatric wards, close follow-up of discharged patients and specialized teams. In these difficult financial times, it is wrong to cut back on these essential mental health services when we need them the most. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ACCORDING to recent figures for every 4 older people thinking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , one of them will act on their thoughts and take their own life. Think about what this means. If your (four) grandparents where considering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as an option, statistically one of them would act on those thoughts. To combat the threat of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Lifeline is presenting safeTALK. This half-day talk aims to increase \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  alertness. Lee-Ann Foord, Life Matters co-ordinator for Lifeline Mid Coast, said the more people we have trained in being alert to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the more lives we can save. "This program alerts community members to signs that a person may be considering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," she said. "It acknowledges that while most people at risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  signal their distress and invite help, these intervention opportunities are often overlooked. Participants learn to recognise when someone may have thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and to respond in ways that link them with further \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  intervention help." safeTALK raises awareness and contributes to a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  safer community. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  alert community members are better prepared to become a vital link in connecting persons at risk with further help. safeTALK will be held at Lifeline, Sherwood Road Port Macquarie on Wednesday November 2 from 9am - 12.30pm. Cost $35. For bookings and information please phone the Lifeline office 6581-2800.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Earlier this week, Baldev 'Baldy' Singh, 58, a distinguished test pilot and a  director with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, hanged himself on the outskirts of Bangalore. A few weeks ago, a 24-year old MBA student, Malini Murmu, killed herself in her IIM-Bangalore hostel. Both cases made national headlines. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But in Bangalore, hundreds of lesser-known \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases are catalogued in police records. According to the National Crime Records Bureau's (NCRB) chief statistical officer Akhilesh Kumar, for many years Bangalore has been India's number one city in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The data for 2010, as yet unreleased, reinforces that India's Silicon City is also its \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Capital.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 2009, Bangalore recorded 2,167 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  versus 1,051 in teeming Mumbai, and 1,215 in the more-populous Delhi city. Data published by the NCRB shows that Bangalore is also number one in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate (\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 population), a trend that the big city shares with smaller towns like Jabalpur, Rajkot and Coimbatore.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr N Satish Chandra, the director of NIMHANS, blames it on rapid socio-cultural changes in the face of furious development. Bangalore is a city of wannabe achievers who want the maximum, he says. "It is a city where failure is not an option."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Every Tuesday afternoon, counsellor Anita Gracias becomes "Anu" and works the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  helpline at SAHAI. "Bangalore has a large population pouring in from every remote corner to study and work. They ask, 'Who do I trust?' Where can I make a genuine friend?'." Many callers at the helpline, she adds, dial in to ask about the most painless form of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Bangalore is the country's third most-populous city alright. But it is also India's loneliest city, says Gracias.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Mohan Isaac has extensively studied the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  trend in Bangalore. Now at the School of Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Western Australia, he points to the data from Bangalore and Kolkata. During the past few years, Bangalore has seen more than 2,000 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  annually, a rate of 38 per lakh population. Kolkata's annual number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  during this time was around 200. Slow-to-modernise Kolkata has retained the lowest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate amongst 35 Indian cities, says Dr Isaac.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Silicon City as '\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Capital'
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * As per National Crime Records Bureau, Bangalore India's No. 1 city in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Its \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate (\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  per 100,000 population) is also highest in country
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * It accounts for about 16% of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in India's 30 biggest cities
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Most of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are by those in their prime - between the ages of 16 and 40

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SOUTH African \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  statistics in general are alarming. This was the conclusion of Professor Lourens Schlebusch, an expert on stress and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , after conducting research on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the country.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Schlebusch says that about 6 000 to 8 000 people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in South Africa every year, making \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  the third greatest cause of unnatural death in the country after homicide and unintentional causes.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He says that about one third of all patients admitted to hospital after attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are children or teenagers. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 And he says that fatal \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are only part of the story: for every fatal \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  there are at least 20 attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), about one million people worldwide die from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every year and predictions are that by 2020, this figure is likely to escalate to approximately 1.53 million people per annum.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to Schlebusch, recent research in the country shows that on average, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  accounts for 9.5 percent of non-natural deaths in young people and 11 percent in adults. The finding that younger and younger people are committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  raises concern.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Ten years ago, the elderly were most at risk of committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Nowadays, younger people are committing or attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," said Schlebusch.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There has been a shift in suicidal behaviour from the elderly to younger people in South Africa.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The average age for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is around 35 and almost one third of all non-fatal suicidal behaviours involve adolescents. The South African Depression and Anxiety Group's (Sadag) school-based teenage \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention programme "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Shouldn't be a Secret" - funded by Lotto - aims to reduce the high incidence of teenage \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in South Africa.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Teen \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a preventable tragedy and only through destigmatisation and education, through teaching peers and teachers to recognise warning signs and intervene, can we save lives," said Sadag's Cassey Chambers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to Schlebusch's research, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  methods differ across socio-demographic groups.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hanging accounts for between 34 percent and 43 percent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , firearms for between 29 percent and 35 percent, ingestion of poison for between 9 percent and 14 percent, gassing for between 6 percent and 7 percent, burning for between 2 percent and 4 percent, and jumping from a height for between 2 percent and 4 percent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Regarding non-fatal suicidal behaviour, the overall method of choice in 90 percent of cases is overdose: over-the-counter analgesics and prescription medications are commonly used, along with household utility products such as paraffin, pesticides and various poisons.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is generally thought to be mainly a female issue but, according to Sadag and Schlebusch, it is actually higher among males than females. "We are getting more and more calls from men who are depressed and stressed, often because of financial issues," said Chambers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Men often show their stress by working too hard, drinking and engaging in extra-marital affairs - they display aggression rather than depression. Five times more men commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than women.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sadag also runs the country's only toll-free \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  crisis line - 0800 567 567 - open seven days a week from 8am to 8pm.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There is often a lack of awareness of the prevalence of suicidal behaviour. To raise awareness surrounding this issue, Sadag observes World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day on September 10.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As part of the day, the Durban North Crisis Team (supported by Sadag and the WHO) will be holding their fourth annual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Remembrance Walk in Umhlanga.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The "Into the Light Walk" focuses public attention on understanding \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , highlighting effective prevention activities and walking in memory of those lost to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The walk will take place at the CJ Saunders Park in Umhlanga on September 11 at 8.30am.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SOUTH African \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  statistics in general are alarming. This was the conclusion of Professor Lourens Schlebusch, an expert on stress and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , after conducting research on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the country.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 LIFELINE has announced the creation of the Lifeline Foundation for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention aimed at building knowledge about how to reduce lives lost to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Australia.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lifeline's CEO, Dr Maggie Jamieson, said that Lifeline was unhappy that the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in Australia remained high compared to other preventable causes of death.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "As the leading charity for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention in Australia, we feel that more must be done to reduce deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in this country," Dr Jamieson said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The 2010 Senate Inquiry into \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Australia identified that extensive research and evaluation must be done so we can learn more about what works and why, in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Lifeline Foundation for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention will work with academic and clinical experts to harness their knowledge and better understand:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  How to best reach out and make the offer of help to people who are feeling suicidal 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  How to equip people in the community to identify the signs of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  earlier, and 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  How to best support those who are experiencing the loss of a loved one to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "With one Australian dying by their own hand every four hours, and with someone attempting \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every 15 minutes, we also need to work with all Australians to learn how to best reach people in crisis," Dr Jamieson said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "One of the priorities of the Foundation will be to address the single greatest social need in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention - the four times higher rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We believe the benefits of Lifeline's Foundation will have a far reaching impact at all levels of the Australian community. The knowledge gained by the Foundation will help us better reach out to suicidal people and build more resilient, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  safer communities."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lifeline is calling for corporate, philanthropic and individual donations to help support this vital initiative.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When someone takes their life, the devastating impact reaches far beyond the immediate family to schools, workplaces and the wider community.

\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is complex. There is no one reason why someone may choose to end his or her life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Each \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is different and can be triggered by a range of factors including relationship problems, drug and alcohol misuse, mental health problems, lack of employment, or problems with family and the law.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 However it is important to remember that few people want their life to end, rather they want the pain and difficulties they are experiencing to stop.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Most people who plan to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  do express signs of intent but these are often not recognised or understood.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Some behavioural warning signs may include:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Talking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Making a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  plan
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Self-harming or previous \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Social withdrawal from family and friends
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Giving away prized possessions
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Uncharacteristic use of alcohol and drugs
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Little interest in the future
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Increase in risk-taking behaviour
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Tidying or finalising affairs
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * A sense of hopelessness/helplessness
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 * Giving up activities that were previously important
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Spend time with the person and voice your concerns. Ask if they are thinking of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  This can be hard but you won't put the idea in a person's head by talking about it and it may be a relief for them to be able to express their feelings.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There are about one million deaths from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  around the world every year with one person taking their own life every 45 seconds, the world congress of the International Association for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention heard yesterday.      
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Jose Manoel Bertolote of the World Health Organisation told delegates attending the conference in Killarney that in addition to this there were between 10 and 40 million \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts, or one \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt every five seconds, across the globe.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This is a serious public health problem as well as a tragedy for families," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He added that traditionally \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , which he described as a terrible plague, had been highest among the elderly but in many countries now like Ireland and New Zealand \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates peaked among younger age groups.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We are witnessing a serious shift," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said the WHO was working with 25 countries to develop strategies for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention. "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a public health issue that can and should be prevented," he added. One of the main issues for many countries was having appropriate mental healthcare services, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The conference heard details of how \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  trends vary across countries and Prof Michael Philips, executive director of the Beijing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Research and Prevention Centre, told delegates that in China the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is twice that of Ireland and is far more common in rural than urban areas.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There are an estimated 287,000 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a year in China.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Furthermore, he said, research in China had found that about one-third of those who die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and two-thirds of those who attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had no diagnosable mental illness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This differed, he said, from in the west where "at least 95 per cent" of people who die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  have a diagnosable mental illness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "A lot of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in China are impulsive, a fight with the husband and you go home, you take pesticide and you're dead two hours later. So even thought they are very distraught and upset at the time, this is not what we in the professional world would consider mental illness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "So the question is how do you deal with those. Then you go to think how can you decrease impulsiveness and change people's methods of coping with particular family stress because that's the major factor that's pushing people to these impulsive \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said different countries needed different strategies. "Every county has its specific problems.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "For example in Ireland the increase in alcohol use, particularly binge drinking, is a serious problem.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The question is how do you address it. How can you change that. It's a complex problem," said Prof Philips.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Around 300 to 400 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are committed in Singapore each year, which works out to one a day.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Females attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  more often. But males use more violent methods to end their lives and are more likely to die. The gender ratio of those who take their own lives is about 1.7 men to one woman here. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Most prone to killing themselves are the Chinese (with a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate of 12 per 100,000 people per year), followed by Indians (11.2) and Malays (2.2).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Financial problems accounted for about a third of Singapore male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and 12 per cent of female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  between 2000 and 2002. These ranged from debts, losses, gambling, unpaid credit card bills and loan shark pressures.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Between 1995 and 2002, there were 79 gamblers here who commited \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Of these, 68 were men and 11 women. The majority, 76 per cent, were Chinese. There was only one case each for Malays, Indians and Japanese.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 An overwhelming 70 per cent of Singaporeans who commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  jump to their death from high-rise buildings. The rest hang, gas, poison, burn or drown themselves.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Between 2000 and 2002, 29 Indian foreign workers here took their own lives. Another 30 Indonesian maids and six Filipino maids also committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the same time frame.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Overall, Singapore's rate of female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ranked 14th and male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  28th out of 50 countries ranked worldwide.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prone countries in the world today are former Eastern bloc communist countries such as Hungary, Lithuania and Latvia, where hardship, instability and regime change have taken their toll.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In most Western countries, winter traditionally sees a lower rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and summer a higher rate. Singapore, which doesn't have seasons, seems to have no concrete \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  pattern. But popular days for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  here are the second day of Chinese New Year, New Year's Day, Christmas, Labour Day and Deepavali.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Is the media contributing to Caltrain \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 After a recent spate of people taking their lives in front of speeding trains on Caltrain tracks, one prominent rail safety official said he is convinced that newspaper and TV coverage is spurring copycat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The media's job is to report, no question about it," said Art Lloyd, president of the state chapter of Operation Lifesaver and a member of Caltrain's board of directors. "But part of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  problem is people looking in the newspaper and thinking 'This is a good way to take my life.'" 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The link between media coverage and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a thorny question with no clear-cut answer, but one Caltrain officials have often grappled with as they seek to stop \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that have claimed the lives of 118 people since 1992.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lloyd calls the phenomenon the "Golden Gate Syndrome," after heavy media coverage of jumpers from the Golden Gate Bridge, he believes, drew other people to take their lives in the same way.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Lloyd said he would not tell the media how to cover Caltrain \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , but said press accounts of deaths are often too sensational. Many other Caltrain officials don't see a link between media coverage and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "[\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims] are already in a certain state of mind," said Mike Nevin, a County Supervisor and a Caltrain board member. "I don't see how what's printed in the newspaper really affects that."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But at least one study shows coverage of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by a prominent newspaper or television news may have the effect of increasing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among readers or viewers, especially when \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  stories are frequent and prominently played.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 1994, an Austrian research team found \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in front of the Vienna subway dropped by 80 percent in the six months after reporters began covering the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  less extensively and dramatically.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The total number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Vienna also dropped as well.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Local newspapers defended their coverage of Caltrain \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Caltrain is a form of public transportation that people take, so they need to know about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," said Jamie Casini, mid-County editor for The Independent. "I just feel that a person that is going to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is very depressed ... they are going to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  anyway regardless of newspaper coverage."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Eve Meyer, executive director of the San Francisco \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention, said there are steps newspapers can take steps to present a balanced picture of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Stories should be written matter-of-factly," Meyer said. "They should also not make the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  seem inevitable, mysterious or magnetic in any way."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Caltrain officials said they would never ask the media to stop covering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , even though since the 1980s most media outlets have curtailed their coverage of people jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's not an apple to apple comparison," said Rita Haskin, chief communications officer for Caltrain. "When someone commits \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in front of Caltrain, it affects hundreds of riders and can close streets. A Caltrain \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has an impact beyond someone just jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But Caltrain officials have undertaken a vigorous campaign to curb images of unsafe use of the rails in the media. Caltrain officials wrote to Macy's a few years ago when the department store ran a clothing add featuring people walking on train tracks.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 They have also written letters to The Times and San Francisco Chronicle, when similar pictures have appeared in those newspapers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In recent years, Caltrain officials have taken a number of steps to curb \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , including fencing in sections of track and posting hundreds of signs that have \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention hotline phone numbers along the rails and in stations.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 So far, there have been six deaths on the rails this year, including five \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The County Coroner has not made a ruling on the sixth death.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  " When someone commits \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in front of Caltrain, it affects hundreds of riders and can close streets. A Caltrain \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has an impact beyond someone just jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb0 \fi0    The police are investigating the deaths of two college students who allegedly committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Thursday after visiting an Internet site which advocates \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  local police said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A spokesman for Kangnung Police Station said two college students were found dead in a motel room, apparently after drinking poison around 1 a.m.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The police rushed to the scene after another college student, identified only as Kim, 26, informed them of the incident. Kim said he was with the two students at the time of their alleged \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Kim called the police while returning to Seoul, where he attends college, after witnessing the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He was quoted as saying, "I met them through an Internet \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  site.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Everybody else just talked about committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide.\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  They actually did it."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "I felt so afraid that I ran away," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although Kim made the call anonymously, the police were able to track him down by tracing his call.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The initial police investigation revealed that the three arrived in Kangnung in Kim's car Wednesday night and drank together at a pub before entering the motel.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 One of the two alleged \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  had spent time in a psychiatric hospital after attempting to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in September and the other was under pressure to repay credit card debts incurred through gambling on horse- races, the police said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 To get to the bottom of the case, the police are attempting to persuade the informant to give further testimony voluntarily.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If the deaths were indeed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  it will be the country's first case of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  actually being influenced by an Internet \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  site, although it is not yet clear which site the two students used.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Police are concerned about the possibility of copycat \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides,\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as there are a variety of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  sites available on the Internet.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 WASHINGTON Gun control advocates talk about "the gun show loophole" and "child safety locks." People who support owning firearms talk about "our constitutional rights" and "self-defense." But one word is rarely mentioned in the gun debate: \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 This, despite the fact that more people in the United States die from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than homicides, and most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are committed with a
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 gun. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When groups pushing for gun control quote numbers for "violent gun deaths," they include \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , which often account for more than half of the total.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 When the National League of Cities erected a "Wall of Gun Deaths" at the Million Mom March this month, 658 of the names on it were \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "If you have a gun in the home, the risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is five times higher," said Kimberly Mariani, a spokeswoman for Handgun Control Inc., the leading gun control advocacy organization.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The group says reducing the number of guns will help reduce \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . They cite studies showing that many \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are the result of impulsive behavior and that the increased rate of youth \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  over the past four decades is largely related to the use of guns.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate for people 15 to 19 years old increased 11 percent from 1980 to 1997, and most of that increase is due to gun \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 1997, 1,135 teens in that
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 age group committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  with a gun.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Over all age groups, guns were involved in 17,566 of the 30,535 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  that year, the CDC reported.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The National Rifle Association denies that guns are responsible for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The group says firearms are "merely implements utilized to accomplish the act, implements for which others would be substituted if firearms were not available."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The NRA also contends that availability of guns in a city or country does not translate into a high rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A cause-and-effect relationship between guns and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates is hard to establish.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 For example, in the District of Columbia, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is lower than in any state, while the gun homicide rate is high.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The low \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is likely a consequence of the racial makeup of the district, which is mostly black. In 1997, white males accounted for 72 percent of all \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and whites as a group accounted for 90 percent, according to the CDC.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 International comparisons are of little help, because reporting methods vary among countries, as do cultural and religious attitudes toward \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to a recent report from the World Health Organization, the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in Israel is low 8.2 per 100,000 in 1996 compared with a U.S. rate of 19.3 even though many households have guns because of compulsory military duty for men and women.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 But in the United Kingdom, where gun control laws are strict, the 1997 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is also lower than in the United States, 11 per 100,000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Many counselors and doctors strongly support gun control as a method of reducing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Alan Berman, executive director of the American Association of Suicidology, said that the probability of death in a gun \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempt is 92 percent, much higher than with other methods.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Unfortunately, it's lethal in a moment of despair," he said. "It doesn't give the person a chance to change their mind."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Firearm safety is one of the goals of the Washington-based nonprofit association that promotes research and public education about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and training for crisis volunteers.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Berman advocates several gun control proposals, including child trigger locks, part of a juvenile crime package that is stuck in Congress.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Senate last year passed a crime bill that would require the locks, require buyers at gun shows to undergo background checks, and ban importing large-capacity ammunition clips. The bill would also prohibit juveniles with serious criminal records from possessing guns for life.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A similar House bill did not include the gun provisions, and a compromise between the two versions has eluded negotiators, with the gun show language being the biggest sticking point.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Australians are killing themselves at a younger age, with male teenage \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates doubling over the past two decades.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Australian Bureau of Statistics figures released yesterday show 2683 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 1998, a slight fall on 1997 figures but still the second highest number since statistics were first recorded in 1921. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Overall \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates have remained relatively static since 1921, accounting for about 1-2 per cent of deaths, the report said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The biggest increase in deaths from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occurred in the 15 to 24 age group. In 1921, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths accounted for only 3 per cent of male fatalities in this age group, but increased to 27 per cent by 1998.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report said the rise was partly the result of declining death rates from car accidents and cancer.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths in this age group have more than doubled since 1976-80 when it accounted for just under 12 per cent of male deaths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The rising trend in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  death rates among the young, and particularly among males, began in the 1960s and gathered momentum in the 1980s," the report said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in this age group also increased substantially as a proportion of all causes of death from 1921 to 1998, rising from 1.3 per cent to 16 per cent.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 1921, people older than 65 had the highest rate of death by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . By the 1960s it shifted to the 50 to 54 age group and by 1996 those in the 25 to 29 age group had the highest \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates peaked in the Depression and fell during World War II, rising again in 1963 when it accounted for 17.5 deaths per 100,000 people.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates have always been significantly higher than female rates, the ratio has varied from a high of five male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths for every female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in 1921, to a low of two-to-one in 1966.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has remained a largely male tragedy. Unmarried and divorced people and those living in rural areas are more likely to die from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than people who are married and living in the city.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 1998, the Northern Territory recorded the highest death rate from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  (21 per 100,000).

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Hard times are driving increasing numbers of NSW farmers to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and the real incidence of rural \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  may be much higher than has been reported, a State parliamentary inquiry heard yesterday. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A "wall of silence" surrounds rural \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and many reported car accidents are disguised \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , a farmers' representative told the inquiry.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Upper House Committee on Social Issues was also told that while NSW ranks highly in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  preventative care, awareness of suicidal tendencies remains low among rural communities.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The acting chief executive of the NSW Farmers' Association, Mr Terry Ryan, said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  trends were "always related to the economic fortunes of farmers"
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Since the 1960s, when NSW farms began disappearing at the rate of five to eight a week, the rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among young males in rural areas has risen by up to 10 times.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The largest increase has been among males aged from 15 to 19 in towns with fewer than 4,000 people, where the rate has risen from 3.6 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  deaths per 100,000 people in the mid-60s to 31.6 per 100,000 in 1991.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures do not cover the present drought, but Mr Ryan said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  followed economic fortunes, even on a year-by-year basis.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "There has been a drop-off in the number of reported \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  after a good crop last year, but things are worse this year and we expect an increase again early next year, when farmers' bills are due," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Rural \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was underreported, because there was "a wall of silence when discussion of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  came in".
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Ryan said the social stigma of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for rural families caused suicidal men to drive their cars deliberately into trees or oncoming trucks.The director of mental health with the NSW Department of Health, Dr Noel Wilton, said NSW ranked highest among Australian States in caring for suicidal patients in rural areas, but a lack of community awareness obstructed successful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Breaking down the stigma of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  means reducing discrimination against people with mental illness," Dr Wilton said. Eighty-five per cent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  victims were found to have a pre-existing mental disorder.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Wilton said another effective method of reducing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was limiting access to the means to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He listed firearms, car exhaust fumes with a high carbon monoxide content and barbiturates among the reducible means.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Firearms, while on the decline as a factor in the overall \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  toll, were still commonly used in rural \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Wilton recommended tighter gun registration and storage laws.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The State president of the Sporting Shooters' Association, Mr Roy Smith, rejected calls for tighter gun controls.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Mr Smith told the committee gun-owners were not over-represented in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , and the registration of all firearms was neither possible nor desirable.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "NSW gun laws are already very onerous, and making them tighter would discourage owners from coming forward and registering them," he said.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The pledge comes as ministers unveiled a new \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategy that is aiming to cut the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate and provide more support to bereaved families

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Around 4,200 people in England took their own lives in 2010 and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  continues to be a public health issue - especially in the current period of economic uncertainty, the Department of Health said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is highest amongst men aged between 35-49, while men are three times more likely than women to take their own life, according to statistics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The new strategy, which is being backed by charity the Samaritans, is the first in more than 10 years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Under the fresh approach, the government will work with the UK Council for Child Internet Safety to help parents ensure their children are not accessing harmful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -related websites.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It will also aim to reduce opportunities for \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by ensuring prisons and mental health facilities keep people safer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Improved support for high-risk groups - such as those with mental health problems and people who self-harm - and well as those bereaved or affected by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  will also be offered.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Chair of the National \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Strategy Advisory Group, Louis Appleby said: "\cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  does not have one cause - many factors combine to produce an individual tragedy.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Prevention too must be broad - communities, families and front-line services all have a vital role.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "The new strategy will renew the drive to lower the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in England."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Around 50 national organisations from the voluntary, statutory and private sectors have also agreed to work together to tackle \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by sharing best practice and providing support to those in need.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Simon Lawton-Smith, head of policy at the Mental Health Foundation, said: "We welcome this new strategy. It provides continuing momentum to the good work done over the past decade in reducing the number of people who take their own lives each year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "However, there are still over five and a half thousand \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year in the UK, with over 4,000 of these occurring in England alone. More worryingly, the recent decrease in the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate seems to have halted. It is therefore even more important that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention remains a high priority in a time of continued economic uncertainty."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 ACCORDING to recent figures for every 4 older people thinking about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , one of them will act on their thoughts and take their own life. Think about what this means. If your (four) grandparents where considering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as an option, statistically one of them would act on those thoughts. To combat the threat of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Lifeline is presenting safeTALK. This half-day talk aims to increase \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  alertness. Lee-Ann Foord, Life Matters co-ordinator for Lifeline Mid Coast, said the more people we have trained in being alert to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the more lives we can save. "This program alerts community members to signs that a person may be considering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," she said. "It acknowledges that while most people at risk of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  signal their distress and invite help, these intervention opportunities are often overlooked. Participants learn to recognise when someone may have thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and to respond in ways that link them with further \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  intervention help." safeTALK raises awareness and contributes to a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  safer community. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  alert community members are better prepared to become a vital link in connecting persons at risk with further help. safeTALK will be held at Lifeline, Sherwood Road Port Macquarie on Wednesday November 2 from 9am - 12.30pm. Cost $35. For bookings and information please phone the Lifeline office 6581-2800.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Navi Mumbai: Data from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) revealed that the number of men committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  within the Navi Mumbai police commissionerate has gone up by almost 29% in the one-year period between 2012 and 2013. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Interestingly, out of the total number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , males top the chart. In 2013, out of a total of 258 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , 174 were committed by men, which is about 67% of the total \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The figures also show that there has been an overall increase in the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Navi Mumbai compared to the previous year. The CID data reveals that in 2012, 217 people had committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , out of which 135 were men and 82 were women.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Among the total number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the state, Mumbai is at top with 1,322 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , followed by Pune (880), Jalgaon (790), Pune Rural (673) and Thane (653). The data also reveals that the least number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were recorded in the smaller towns like Sindhudurg (117), Gondia (147) and Washim (175).
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A senior police officer told TOI that most of the people ended their lives by hanging themselves, jumping from high-rises, consuming poison, having an overdose of drugs, jumping in a water body and, in rare cases, by setting themselves on fire. Committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  by shooting themselves constituted the rarest of cases.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The police said that they were unable to attribute the rise in the total number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  to any one factor. However, going by the cases registered, the tendency to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was observed in people irrespective of socio-economic status. Some of the most common reasons were family problems, illness, depression, marital problems and peer pressure.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Among youngsters, relationship issues and high stress as a result of growing educational expectations are considered as the main reasons behind the growing rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . In recent years, emotional issues or failed love affairs have been seen in many cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," said a senior police officer.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Men rank higher than women even in the entire state. The data stated that in 2013, 16,622 people committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  out of which 11,892 were men, which is roughly 71% of the total cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Text of editorial" \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicides!\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 " in English by Sudanese government newspaper Sudan Vision website on 22 October
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Last week the newspapers published several articles about Sudanese citizens who committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . From those a news about a kid who hanged himself with his mother's scarf, the Ethiopian who was found hanged on a tree, a bride who was found floating on the Nile and the youngster who burnt himself after pouring benzene on his body. An official report issued by civil defence police revealed the pulling out of two to three corpses daily from the River Nile including several \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases. According a report from World Health Organizations (WHO) issued last month Sudan registered the highest record of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases in the Arab World. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The report of World Health Organizations (WHO) on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention called for coordinated action to reduce \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  worldwide considering that more than 800 000 people die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every year - around one person every 40 seconds. According to WHO report on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, some 75 percent of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occur in low- and middle-income countries. Pesticide poisoning, hanging and firearms are among the most common methods of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  globally. According to statistics \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate in Sudan is 11.5 against every 100 thousand persons which is very high. The question is do we have any institution that follow-up and monitors the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases within the society?
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Such official body is very important to determine the causes of each case individually for the purpose of study and analysis to come out with recommendations that lead to, at least, reducing the rate. Reducing access to means of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is one way to reduce deaths. Other effective measures include responsible reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the media, such as avoiding language that sensationalizes \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and avoiding explicit description of methods used, and early identification and management of mental and substance use disorders in communities and by health workers in particular.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Follow-up care by health workers through regular contact, including by phone or home visits, for people who have attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , together with provision of community support, are essential, because people who have already attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are at the greatest risk of trying again. It is high time to take effective measures even just starting at local level as World Health Organizations (WHO) recommends.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  More than 800,000 people die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every year - around one person every 40 seconds, according to WHO's first global report on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention, published today. Some 75% of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occur in low- and middle-income countries. Pesticide poisoning, hanging and firearms are among the most common methods of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  globally. Evidence from Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the United States and a number of European countries reveals that limiting access to these means can help prevent people dying by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . Another key to reducing deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a commitment by national governments to the establishment and implementation of a coordinated plan of action. Currently, only 28 countries are known to have national \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention strategies. \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occurs all over the world and can take place at almost any age. Globally, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates are highest in people aged 70 years and over. In some countries, however, the highest rates are found among the young. Notably, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the second leading cause of death in 15-29 year-olds globally. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "This report is a call for action to address a large public health problem which has been shrouded in taboo for far too long" said Dr Margaret Chan, Director-General of WHO. Generally, more men die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than women. In richer countries, three times as many men die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than women. Men aged 50 years and over are particularly vulnerable. In low- and middle-income countries, young adults and elderly women have higher rates of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than their counterparts in high-income countries. Women over 70 years old are more than twice as likely to die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than women aged 15-29 years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Reducing access to means of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is one way to reduce deaths. Other effective measures include responsible reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the media, such as avoiding language that sensationalizes \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and avoiding explicit description of methods used, and early identification and management of mental and substance use disorders in communities and by health workers in particular. Follow-up care by health workers through regular contact, including by phone or home visits, for people who have attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , together with provision of community support, are essential, because people who have already attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are at the greatest risk of trying again.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "No matter where a country currently stands in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention", said Dr Alexandra Fleischmann, Scientist in the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse at WHO, "effective measures can be taken, even just starting at local level and on a small-scale". WHO recommends countries involve a range of government departments in developing a comprehensive coordinated response.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 High-level commitment is needed not just within the health sector, but also within education, employment, social welfare and judicial departments. "This report, the first WHO publication of its kind, presents a comprehensive overview of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts and successful \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention efforts worldwide. We know what works. Now is the time to act," said Dr Shekhar Saxena, Director of the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse at WHO. The report's launch comes just a week before World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, observed on 10 September every year.

\par \pard 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 India, Sept. 8 -- Governments and communities must acknowledge that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a major threat to public health. Fighting it requires a multi-sectoral and sensitive strategy
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to a new World Health Organisation report, India accounted for the highest estimated number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the world in 2012. Globally, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  accounted for over 8,00 000 deaths that year and the estimated \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is the highest in WHO's South-East Asia region which includes India.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 As \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a sensitive issue - and even illegal in some countries - many cases go unreported. World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, observed each year on 10 September is, therefore, a global opportunity to raise awareness and promote joint action to protect those who are vulnerable to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  characteristics differ based on a country's economic status. The age-standardised rate of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is higher in high-income countries. However, given that a much larger proportion of the global population resides in the low and middle-income countries, the latter account for the bulk of deaths, with 75.5 per cent of all global \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  occurring in these countries. Thirty-nine per cent of the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in LMICs are reported from WHO's South-East Asia region, which has 11 countries and is home to a quarter of the global population.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Overall, more men commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than women, but again there are variations based on the economic status of the country. In richer countries, three times more men commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  than women, but in LMICs this ratio is 1.5 men to each woman. In most countries, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates are highest in people 70 years and over, but young people aged 15-29 are also particularly vulnerable.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Pesticide self-poisoning is the most common method of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , resulting in one third of all deaths, in LMICs. In high-income countries, hanging and firearms are more common methods.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The prevalence, characteristics and methods of suicidal behaviour vary widely between different communities, in different demographic groups and over time. Consequently, up-to-date surveillance of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts is an essential component of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention efforts. This task is much more difficult than it appears. Obtaining high-quality actionable data is difficult. Until this changes, and communities recognise \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as a public health danger, we will be on the losing side of the fight to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Governments play a pivotal role in this fight. The first step in this battle is to create a national strategy, stating a clear commitment to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention. Currently, only 28 countries have such a strategy. Ensuring collaboration between multiple stakeholders and sectors-public and private-is essential.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Countries must restrict access to the most common means of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . In India and Sri Lanka, restricting access to pesticides locally through locked storage facilities has been effective in lowering \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates. Evidence from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the US and several European countries suggests that restricting access to firearms has been associated with a drop in firearm \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Follow-up care for people who have attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is critical, as they are at great risk of trying again. Social support within communities can help protect the vulnerable by building up their coping skills and sense of connectedness.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Responsible media reporting has also been shown to decrease \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates. This includes educating the public about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , risk factors and where to seek help; avoiding sensationalism; and avoiding detailed descriptions of suicidal acts. Governments can help by releasing public service announcements that raise awareness, identifying and treating mental and substance-use disorders as early as possible, and ensuring those vulnerable to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  receive the care they need before it is too late. Mental health and alcohol policies should be integrated into overall health-care services, and Governments should ensure sufficient funding to improve these services.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Worldwide, the prevention of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  has not been adequately addressed due to lack of awareness. Only a few countries have included prevention of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  among their priorities. It is clear that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention requires intervention from outside the health sector as well. It calls for an innovative, comprehensive multi-sectoral approach, including both health and non-health sectors, for example education, labour, police, justice, religion, law, politics and the media.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 If you are interested in becoming part of a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 -safer community, a presentation by safeTALK will take place this week. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On Thursday, May 15, from 1 to 4:30 p.m., a presentation will take place at the Alberni Valley United Church, encouraging local residents to get involved.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 safeTALK is a brief training which prepares participants to identify persons with suicidal thoughts and it connects them to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  first-aid resources.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The group is for everyone who wants to help prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , including front-line workers, clergy, volunteers, parents, grandparents, youth over age 15, teachers, law enforcement officers and anyone who wants to help prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 During training, participants learn how to provide practical help by learning and practicing basic TALK (Tell, Ask, Listen, and Keepsafe) steps that facilitate links with further \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  first aid help for persons with thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Once training is complete, participants can expect to leave more able to perform an important helping role for persons with thoughts of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Improved \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  alertness can be applied in many settings from family, friends, co-workers and in relationships.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  alert community members are better prepared to become connect persons at risk with further help, which in turn contributes to a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  safer community.
\par \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is a critical public and community health priority. In Canada, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates among men are roughly four times higher for women and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is the second leading cause of death among youth, ages 15 to 24. It is also the leading cause of death for those between ages 25 and 49.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The training will be held at the Alberni Valley United Church, located at 3747 Church Street.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0  Pacific Islands Development, The State of Hawaii has issued the following news release:
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The growing trend of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases in Fiji is a reality which needs to be addressed, says Commissioner of Police Brigadier-General Ioane Naivalurua as World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day is acknowledged throughout the globe today. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Brig-Gen Naivalurua has challenged members of the community to step forward and assist police address this social problem.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said public awareness campaigns such as World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day is being facilitated to prevent and reduce the number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  incidents which the Fiji Police continues to be challenged with.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We need to raise awareness that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is preventable, improve education about causes of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , decrease stigmatization, join hands and reach out to our fellow humans who may be emotionally distressed and need our help," Brig-Gen Naivalurua said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "It's extremely worrying that most \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  cases arise from an issue that could have easily been resolved through dialogue."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Commissioner is adamant that more proactive measures need to be adopted to prevent further loss of innocent lives.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "While today has been specifically set aside to raise awareness on the prevention of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , the issue at hand needs a more concerted and continuous approach and we can't afford to wait once a year and come up with solutions to this issue, particularly since the victims are getting younger and those deemed to be in their productive years," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There have been 80 cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and 83 cases of attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  reported from January to August this year compared to 81 cases of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and 91 cases of attempted \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  were reported for the same period last year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "As Fijians we are always proud of the fact that we live in a communal society so it is sad to see people taking their own lives because they feel isolated to the point that they feel no one around them can help with their problems " he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Police can't deal with this problem alone. We are requesting families to spend time with their loved ones, understand what they're going through, listen and be more understanding."

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Sri Lanka, Sept. 10 -- Mental illness is a major health problem in Sri Lanka but there are only 60 psychiatrists to take care of Lankan patients while the required cadre is 2,100, a workshop was told. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The Director, Mental Health Dr. Rasanjalee Hettiarachchi told the seminar held yesterday at the Health Ministry auditorium to mark today's 'World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day' that there were psychological, biological, social, cultural and environmental factors that lead someone to commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Our duty is to prevent people vulnerable to committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , to falling victims to these factors. The media has a big role to play in this endeavour by distancing the public from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  mentality and refraining from highlighting information on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," she said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The slogan of the World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day 2013 is 'Stigma: A major Barrier to \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention'
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Despite the difficulty and complexity of fighting stigma, persons, organisations and governments committed to the dual goals of improving the quality of life of individuals suffering from mental illnesses and suicidal intentions and of reducing the huge burden of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in families and therefore, communities don't have an option. Unless stigma is confronted and challenged it will continue to be a major barrier to the treatment of mental illnesses and to the prevention of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ," Dr. Hettiarachchi stressed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day provides a special opportunity to refocus our collective energies on addressing this fundamental problem. Changing cultural attitudes about mental illness and suicidal behaviour requires a scientific awareness of the many forces that influence community norms, and the concerted effort of a wide range of community stakeholders over a prolonged period of time. "Lack of access to appropriate care is one of the factors that magnify the stigma associated with mental illness and with suicidal ideation and behaviour. This type of stigma which is deeply rooted in most societies can arise for different reason," she stressed.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr. Neil Fernando, Consultant Psychiatrist said \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was one of the leading causes of death in the world, especially among young people. Nearly one million people worldwide die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  each year. This corresponds to one death by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every 40 seconds. The number of lives lost each year through \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  exceeds the number of deaths due to homicide and war combined. These staggering figures do not include nonfatal \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts which occur much more frequently than deaths by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In a conciliatory note, Dr. Fernando said Sri Lanka had been able to bring down the incidences of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  from a high ratio of 40/100,000 in the nineties to a low 11/100,000 right now. The target of the Health Ministry was to reduce this to a ration of 5/100,000 or less, Dr. Fernando added.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Men aged 85 years and older are committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at a higher rate than any other age group, chief coroner Judge Neil MacLean said in releasing annual \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  statistics.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The line between euthanasia and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  was grey and there needed to be more research into why and where older people were committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , Judge MacLean said. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In the year to June, nine men aged 85 or older committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at a rate of 31 per 100,000. Three women of the same age committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  at a rate of six per 100,000.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Judge MacLean said there needed to be more research into elderly people committing \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Is it in rest homes, in the community, in hospitals?" he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There was no information about the rate of people who may have died through euthanasia, he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Euthanasia is illegal in New Zealand.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Euthanasia is \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . We don't go into details about the euthanasia rate," he said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The total number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  for any age group during the 2012-13 June year was 541, a decrease of six from last year, and two less than the average number of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  during the past six years.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The group with the next-highest rate was 20- to 24-year-old men - 53 men in that category committed \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  last year.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There were the most female (153) and fewest male (388) \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  since records began in 2007.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Before 2012-13 the average male- to-female \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  ratio was about 3 to 1, while in the past year it was about 2.5 to 1, Judge MacLean said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He also spoke about \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  numbers in Christchurch since the 2011 earthquake and said he hoped they would not "peak" next year in line with an international trend after natural disasters. International post-disaster research shows antisocial behaviour and \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  attempts peak in the third year of recovery.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 In 2011-12, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Christchurch dropped from 81 to 68 in the past year. In 2010-11, immediately after the earthquake, there were 67 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  - a drop from the average of between 69 and 90 a year since 2007.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "We experienced an immediate drop in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in Christchurch post-quake but last year those numbers began creeping upwards. This trend has been observed elsewhere after a large-scale natural disaster," Judge MacLean said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 "Some say watch out for the trend . . . about three years out watch out - I hope not."
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 He said a "huge amount" of work was going on in Canterbury to research the phenomenon.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 It was frustrating that New Zealand's \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  total remained "stubbornly consistent" with between 531 and 558 \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  a year, Judge MacLean said.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The rate put New Zealand at one of the highest levels in OECD countries. Fairfax NZ

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 KATHMANDU: Medics today urged the government to raise awareness to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Saroj Ojha, associate professor at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital said joint effort is necessary to raise awareness to reduce the \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 At a programme to mark World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day, he said initiative should be taken by policy makers and the public to raise awareness that \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  is preventable and not a permanent solution to problems.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Every year on September 10, World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day is marked to promote worldwide commitment and action to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . The \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is still low in the country country but hospital-based data show that it is increasing, said Ojha.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The main factors behind \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  are mental health problems, relationships, and marriage and family issues. The Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Study 2008/2009 conducted by Family Health Division (FHD) of the Department of Health Services, on women of reproductive age (15-49) in eight districts, showed that of the 1,496 deaths recorded, \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rather than maternity related issues, was the single leading cause of death, accounting for 16 per cent of deaths.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Although male \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rate is higher, women are at greater risk owing to various cultural and social factors, said Ojha. He added that advocacy of prevention of suicidal behaviour, adequate treatment and follow-up care for people who attempt \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , as well as responsible reporting of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  in the media was very essential.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 According to WHO, on average, almost 3,000 people commit \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  daily. Every year, almost one million people die of \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 ; a "global" mortality rate of 16 per 100,000, or one death every 40 seconds. In the last 45 years \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  rates have increased 60 per cent worldwide.
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Dr Harihar Wasti, medico-legal expert at TUTH said depression, alcohol abuse, violence and education, social and cultural pressures, lack of emotional intelligence and gender based violence are the main reasons behind \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 DROGHEDA'S leading \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  prevention charity has a raft of events organised in and around the south Louth area for World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Week from September 9 to 16.  
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SOSAD, which also has branches in Navan, Dundalk and Cavan, hopes to raise awareness during the week, which includes World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Day on Monday, promoting worldwide commitment and action to prevent \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicides\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 During this week SOSAD will launch a new range of leaflets and booklets to help anyone affected or concerned by depression or \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  as well as a new booklet for those bereaved by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 A road sign campaign will take place around the north east with the slogan 'Speak up, Reach out' in conjunction with the Samaritans. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 SOSAD Ireland will also launch its updated website that week so please look it up at www.sosadireland.ie. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 There will be a special candle vigil in Drogheda. It will take place in Drogheda next Monday in front of St Peter's Church, West Street, starting at 8pm with important contributions from the Mayor Paul Bell and Fr Iggy O'Donovan. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The AIB in Drogheda has kindly agreed to host a SOSAD \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  awareness and information stand in their bank for the whole of World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Week. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Drogheda Youth Development will host a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  information and awareness stand in their offices in Narrow West Street for the week, selling World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention badges and wristbands in a number of locations throughout Drogheda.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The group will be organising Safetalk \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  awareness training in conjunction with the Health Promotion Unit of the HSE in the d hotel on Monday at 2pm.

\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 On average, almost 3,000 people die by \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  every day throughout the world and for every person who completes a \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 , 20 or more may attempt to end their lives. In Ireland nearly two people die every day from \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and thousands have lost someone they loved dearly. 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 Next week we will publish an article on \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  and depression in this newspaper to commemorate World \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 Suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  Prevention Week and educate our community in \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0  awareness as this is a proven way to reduce \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 . 
\par \pard \ql \li0\ri0 \sb120 \fi0 The article will include lots of helpful advice and information that will appeal to all ages and we hope that you are able to join us for some of our events and help us in the fight against \cf17 \b \i0 \ul0 suicide\cf \b0 \i0 \ul0 .
